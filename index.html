			 <p>My week summarized into 3 highlights, 2 discoveries, and 1 anticipation.</p>
<h2 id="3-highlights">3 Highlights</h2>
<p><strong>Eating in</strong><br>
My wife and I have a chronic problem with being unprepared when dinner time rolls around, so we often end up ordering food or going out. My belt and my bank statements would attest that this is not a good practice. But this week we did much better eating in for most of our meals. <del>I found the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.buzzfeed.tasty&amp;hl=en_US&amp;pli=1">Tasty app</a> and have been using that to plan our meals each Saturday so we can pick up groceries on Sunday.</del> Since writing this, I&rsquo;ve switched over to the <a href="https://www.paprikaapp.com/">Paprika</a> app so I can get recipes from more sources (I&rsquo;ve enjoyed <a href="https://www.budgetbytes.com/">Budget Bytes</a>, but I am taking recommendations). I like that the interface is bare-bones, with no fluffy advertising or bright pictures/text. Cooking and eating together has been a delightful time for our family. My daughter has been using the <a href="https://a.co/d/dPsv20c">toddler tower</a> that my parents got her for Christmas to help while cooking. She likes taste-testing ingredients as we cook and watching hot pans on the stove from a distance.</p>
<p><strong>Helping Hands</strong><br>
I didn&rsquo;t have to work on Thursday since federal agencies were closed in remembrance of President Jimmy Carter. Instead, I spent the whole day working on the house with my wife, while each of our moms came over at different times to help watch our daughter. It&rsquo;s amazing how much can get done on a free day with minimal child watching responsibilities. And it was fantastic getting to see and talk with each of our moms.</p>
<p><strong>Green Owl</strong><br>
This week I got back on <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/">DuoLingo</a> to try to revive my Spanish skills. I nearly minored in Spanish in college. I dropped my minor during my last semester, with only two classes left, so that I could focus on my internship. It feels a bit tragic to have been so close and not made it across the finish line, but I would make the same decision again. Since then, I&rsquo;ve been noticing my Spanish comprehension slowly slipping away year by year. I&rsquo;ve been having a lot of fun this week dusting off the cobwebs and experiencing &ldquo;Aha!&rdquo; moments as the intricacies of the Spanish language slowly come back to me. Also, I&rsquo;ve noticed DuoLingo has changed a lot since I last used it a couple of years ago. I read an article about how they are big on &ldquo;gamification&rdquo;, but it&rsquo;s crazy all the tricks they use to make it fun (and addicting) to learn a language. I guess dopamine reward circuit hijacking is okay if it&rsquo;s for a good purpose?</p>
<h2 id="2-discoveries">2 Discoveries</h2>
<p><strong>AI App-Building Platforms</strong><br>
I&rsquo;ve known about these AI coding platforms for a while, but just started playing with them this week and I can&rsquo;t believe how <em>good</em> they are! The main one I&rsquo;ve been messing around with is <a href="https://lovable.dev">lovable.dev</a>. You just give it a prompt, and it will build an app for you in seconds. Then you can tweak the app with more prompts. Once it&rsquo;s ready, you can hook up a database with <a href="https://supabase.com/">Supabase</a> and deploy with <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> or <a href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a>. Gone are the days of people saying with a straight face, &ldquo;I have SUCH GOOD app ideas! I would be a millionaire if only I knew how to build them!&rdquo;. There are no excuses for not building now. Check out this post if you want to learn more: <a href="https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/a-guide-to-ai-prototyping-for-product">A guide to AI prototyping for product managers</a></p>
<p><strong>Wesley Huff</strong><br>
<a href="https://www.wesleyhuff.com/bio">Wesley Huff</a> is a biblical scholar with a <a href="https://www.wesleyhuff.com/">personal website packed with resources on biblical history.</a> I came across him this week on a podcast. His knowledge on original source documents for scripture is impressive. I can tell that he is very well studied from listening to him, and his website has a lot of great <a href="https://www.wesleyhuff.com/infographics">infographics</a> that he has made himself on the bible, manuscripts, archaeology, translation, and more.</p>
<h2 id="1-anticipation">1 Anticipation</h2>
<p><strong>Fitness Challenge</strong><br>
I signed up for a twelve-week fitness challenge through NASA. The main reason I signed up is that I will receive three free body composition reports via calipers and <a href="https://inbodyusa.com/general/inbody-test/">InBody tests</a>, each spaced six weeks apart. I just started intermittent fasting and regular exercise a couple of weeks ago, so I&rsquo;m excited to use these reports as extra motivation to stick with it and see how my body composition changes over the next twelve weeks. I&rsquo;ve already lost 5 pounds in the last week, if my scale can be trusted! I&rsquo;ll have my first test on Tuesday.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m on the couch, coffee in hand, excited to try a new format.</p>
<p>I actually have no idea what the true <em>format</em> will be, but I know that I am going to write weekly. The plan is to have a consistent format for these weeknotes, but I&rsquo;m more concerned with actually doing the thing, so I&rsquo;m starting without the format. Jump first, find a parachute later, right?</p>
<p>Bear with me while I sort things out for the first 5, 10, or 50 of these.</p>
<p>The holiday marathon has come to an end, and it feels like I&rsquo;m settling in for winter now that snow has fallen and stayed for more than 24 hours.</p>
<h2 id="basement">Basement</h2>
<p>Being stuck inside, my attention has turned toward my house and projects that need to be done. The biggest of these is finishing the basement. My wife and I have been getting quotes, with the last of these being last week. We also took a trip to the three major big box stores near us, and must have taken at least $100 worth of samples.</p>
<p>I have completely lost my kitchen island to paint and flooring samples. It looks like a detective is trying to solve a murder, and the primary suspects are green-ish paint, blue-ish paint, and vinyl plank.</p>
<h2 id="1zpresso">1Zpresso</h2>
<p>I bought a really nice manual coffee grinder this week, the <a href="https://1zpresso.coffee/product/j/">1Zpresso J</a>. I thought about it for 7 days and 7 nights, and then decided to go for it.</p>
<p>It feels outrageously-priced for something where I still need to grind my own coffee, but I convinced myself it was worth it after reading endless forum discussions on coffee grinders. Supposedly the machining is incredibly precise and there were people who had been using theirs for 10+ years.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited to feel more connected with my coffee. I&rsquo;m looking forward to the morning ritual of grinding my own beans fresh, and then making a pour over in my <a href="https://chemexcoffeemaker.com/products/six-cup-classic-chemex">Chemex</a>. I&rsquo;m also dreaming of sharing this experience with people who haven&rsquo;t had high quality coffee before. Coffee can be such a wonderfully communal experience.</p>
<p>Anyways, that&rsquo;s probably just all the feel-good stuff I told myself to justify the purchase. It worked.</p>
<h2 id="work">Work</h2>
<p>I went into the office on Thursday and it was pretty quiet. I talked with our IT guy and got to meet the new designer who just joined on the contract.</p>
<p>I had a lot of time off and most people are out of the office, but our team is also all hands on deck for a major release to the NASA Mishap Information System on Jan 12. So it&rsquo;s been one of those quiet-but-busy type of weeks.</p>
<h2 id="health">Health</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been back on intermittent fasting, which has been going well so far. I&rsquo;m trying to only eat between 12-8, but shorter is better. I&rsquo;ve always found that to be the easiest eating pattern for me to follow. I started before the Holiday stretch, which was a bad idea, but things have leveled out now.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also started working out this week (classic New Year). My wife and I have been following along to work out videos on YouTube from our living room each evening, and then stretching afterward. We found a guy that makes videos of Tabata workouts from scenic locations and doesn&rsquo;t do any talking. That was perfect for us.</p>
<p>In addition to our evening workouts we do together, I&rsquo;ve been working out in the mornings. We got <a href="https://www.bowflex.com/product/max-trainer-m6-elliptical/100755.html?adID=DOFG2BFEED1&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiA-Oi7BhA1EiwA2rIu2wMmvpbCby4XFf0dz_TjSoBSkZJMHvR_Uluql7riCQrXj3nRcAgrcBoChyAQAvD_BwE">this treadmill/stair stepper</a> <em>way</em> on sale on Facebook Marketplace recently, so some mornings I use that, or I&rsquo;ve been using the resistance bands I got for Christmas.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure that I would have ever bought resistance bands for myself, but I&rsquo;m really excited for them now that I have them. They&rsquo;re easy to use, and I can do all sorts of different things with them. I&rsquo;m keeping them in my office near my standing desk so that I can get some exercise while I&rsquo;m in meetings for work.</p>
<h2 id="devotional">Devotional</h2>
<p>My wife got me the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Grace-Moment-Note-Taking-Leathersoft-Inspirational/dp/1400236339/ref=asc_df_1400236339?mcid=9d6f4455af77396399ec08b46a615cf0&amp;hvocijid=7501333102641938068-1400236339-&amp;hvexpln=73&amp;tag=hyprod-20&amp;linkCode=df0&amp;hvadid=721245378154&amp;hvpos=&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=7501333102641938068&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=9015351&amp;hvtargid=pla-2281435182378&amp;psc=1">Grace for the Moment</a> devotional for Christmas, and I have used it every day since. Each page is super short, but leaves some space for writing in your own thoughts/reactions. I like being able to slow down with something really short and process through how I feel about it.</p>
<p>This is the first thing I do in the morning (well&hellip; after I get my coffee) and it has felt right to prioritize the first part of my morning to look up to God.</p>
<h2 id="analog">Analog</h2>
<p>I can feel myself moving into an analog renaissance (again). What I mean by that is I&rsquo;m using a lot less digital tools and a lot more physical tools in my day to day.</p>
<p>I have been using my bullet journal to capture daily to-dos and track things on a monthly cadence, including my intermittent fasting. I also <a href="https://weidok.al/2025/01/03/my-latest-attempt-to-be.html">started printing off articles on pieces of paper to carry with me</a> so I don&rsquo;t pull out my phone as much. And I&rsquo;m moving toward taking my sermon notes in a journal instead of digitally, although it has been super cool to see all of my sermon notes and share them from <a href="https://garden.weidok.al/notes/110-sermons/">my digital garden</a>. I&rsquo;m having fun taking notes more visually, drawing ideas/concepts that really resonate with me.</p>
<h2 id="weeknotes-vol-1-postmortem">Weeknotes Vol. 1 Postmortem</h2>
<p>It felt nice to reflect on my week, but this is definitely not the final format.</p>
<p>I want to keep these weeknotes shorter and punchier. I&rsquo;ll be more likely to keep up with it that way. I like how Tim Ferris does his <a href="https://newsletterhunt.com/emails/5878">5 Bullet Friday</a>, so it may end up similar to that.</p>
<p>But I did it. I&rsquo;ll take my win, and I&rsquo;ll see you next week.</p>

			 <p>I just looked through all my old blog post ideas and drafts. There are some fun ideas I forgot about in there.

<p>My first full year of blogging is in the books! Or should I say, in the <a href="https://archive.org/">internet archive</a>? Check out this neat <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/sitemap/weidok.al">sitemap graph of my blog</a> generated by the internet archive.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;ve been doing this for over a year!</p>
<p>One thing that has become clear is I write more like a geyser than a waterfall. I spend most of my time dormant, and then have a sudden flurry of activity before going quiet again. In the new year I would like to move a little more toward the waterfall model: steady, consistent, and reliable. But, I also would like to have more grace for my geyser-like tendencies. The geyser is beautiful in its own way.</p>
<h2 id="articles">Articles</h2>
<p>This year I wrote 34 <a href="https://weidok.al/">articles</a>. Well, 35 if you include this one.</p>
<p>My unspoken goal before the year was one article a week, but I&rsquo;m happy with where I landed. I liked not feeling pressured and being able to write when inspiration struck. That said, I&rsquo;ve been toying with the idea of committing to writing something on a weekly cadence. I&rsquo;ve thought about starting a separate newsletter, but that&rsquo;s more than I want to take on right now. Instead, I&rsquo;m thinking about doing a weekly review post on this blog instead. That will force me to reflect on my life more regularly, and will keep my 8 email subscribers up-to-date with my weekly happenings.</p>
<p>Here are some stats on those 34 articles:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Most popular</strong>: <a href="https://weidok.al/2024/02/15/i-use-my.html">My Obsidian Daily Note Template</a> - this is consistently my most-viewed article. It was my first article of the year, and is a technical deep dive into how I set up my daily notes in my note-taking app. I still get an email roughly monthly from someone asking me further questions about how I set things up in Obsidian. Actually, as I was writing this, someone reached out from the article and asked me if I have implemented &ldquo;heat map habit tracking&rdquo; in Obsidian (I have not). This article had 243 views in the last 90 days. For reference, the next most viewed article over that span had 17 views.</li>
<li><strong>Most words</strong>: <a href="https://weidok.al/2024/02/15/i-use-my.html">My Obsidian Daily Note Template</a> - ~3500 words. The runner-up is my <a href="https://weidok.al/2024/11/28/capturing-shower-thoughts.html">recent post on Aqua Notes</a> at ~1800 words.</li>
<li><strong>Least words</strong>: <a href="https://weidok.al/2024/09/29/this-started-with.html">This Started With A Title</a> - 23 words</li>
<li><strong>Personal Favorite</strong>: <a href="https://weidok.al/2024/09/13/street-corner.html">Street Corner</a> - Although my technical explainer posts seem to get more views, I love writing personal reflections. This one felt really raw. I remember experiencing the moment I describe in the article, and then feeling later that day like I just <em>had</em> to write about it.</li>
<li><strong>Average time spent writing each article</strong>: No idea. I don&rsquo;t track this. But it&rsquo;s pretty short I think. Maybe an hour or two? I don&rsquo;t usually spend multiple days with a lot of editing and researching and refining. I write it and send it.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="microblogs">Microblogs</h2>
<p>I also posted 132 <a href="https://weidok.al/micro/">microblogs</a> this year. A large chunk of those were in January, because I went through the book of Proverbs and did a post for each one trying to summarize the most salient points in my own words. This was my way of &ldquo;<a href="https://weidok.al/2024/01/01/to-start-my.html">starting my year with wisdom</a>&rdquo; and was also meant to get me into the habit of regularly posting to my blog, no matter how uncomfortable it felt at the time.</p>
<h2 id="traffic">Traffic</h2>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t start tracking analytics until later in the year, but since September 432 people have visited my blog.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>About 62 of those users came back to my site at least once, and on average people spend 1 minute and 9 seconds on the blog.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The blog was a global sensation (hyperbole) with visitors from every continent other than Antarctica (shout out to the one visitor from Egypt representing all of Africa).</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>People came to my blog from various corners of the interwebs. Direct traffic, LinkedIn, Google, Reddit, and my newsletter service were all big drivers.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Most people visiting my blog were probably using Chrome on a Windows machine.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>So, what is my takeaway from all of these analytics? Not much. It&rsquo;s fun to look at during the end of the year, but there&rsquo;s nothing actionable for me here. I&rsquo;m not trying to supercharge my blog&rsquo;s growth. I just want to write meaningful and helpful words.</p>
<h2 id="design">Design</h2>
<p>I made various changes to the look and feel of my blog throughout the year. You can see all the changes I made since June 10, 2024 in my <a href="https://weidok.al/changelog/">changelog</a>. It looks <em>very</em> different from where it originally started, which I shared screenshots of in <a href="https://weidok.al/2024/02/24/tear-it-all.html">Tear it All Down</a>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m following the KISS design principle: &ldquo;Keep It Simple Stupid&rdquo;.</p>
<h2 id="what-will-2025-hold">What will 2025 hold?</h2>
<p>Your guess is as good as mine. Will I become an author? Will I abandon my blog and run off with my pen and analog journal? Will artificial intelligence and quantum computing and brain chip implants converge to make the written word irrelevant as we all mind meld and communicate wordlessly and instantly? All possibilities.</p>
<p>As far as my blog goes, 2025 will be similar to 2024. I want to write more, and I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll make design tweaks to my blog here and there. But otherwise I&rsquo;ll continue to write things that I think are meaningful and/or helpful.</p>
<p>As far as my life goes, it looks like change is a brewin'. I&rsquo;m looking forward to the new year and all that it has to offer. Some things are scary, some are exciting, all will make for good writing material.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wait to share my perspective in the new year with you. Thanks for sticking around through my self-indulgent &ldquo;blog in review&rdquo; post.</p>
<p>I wish you a happy new year and hope your year is filled with love, given and received.</p>

			 <p>I learned it&rsquo;s weird to talk to your coworkers about your showering habits.</p>
<p>The slightly uncomfortable laughs gave it away.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s been on my mind because I&rsquo;ve been doing something different in the shower lately. I think showers are more than just a way to get clean. They&rsquo;re also a space to think. While most people have &ldquo;shower thoughts&rdquo;, I bet a majority can&rsquo;t remember them.</p>
<p>When I say that showers are a &ldquo;space to think&rdquo;, I don&rsquo;t just mean they&rsquo;re a place to have thoughts pop in and out. I mean they are a place to do real thinking. To me, real thinking involves:</p>
<ol>
<li>Loading up your <strong>short-term memory</strong> to work through a web of thought.</li>
<li>Moving the important bits over to <strong>long-term memory</strong> for future use.</li>
</ol>
<p>Unfortunately, my brain is terrible at real thinking. It may be an inborn trait, or it may be a symptom of growing up a digital native. My brain feels like it&rsquo;s wired for <em>reacting</em>: social media, texting, news cycles, etc. But I struggle to just&hellip; think.</p>
<p>Except I have a little trick to help me do real thinking: <em>writing things down</em>. The paper is part memory-aid and part memory-replacement. Seeing the words in writing helps encode them in my brain, but it also provides a hard-copy of the thought in case my brain fails to hold onto it. Yet even more helpful is using the paper as my short-term memory. I can follow a long chain of thought and remember every step I took. When my thoughts are trapped in paper, they are outside of me, so it is easier to separate my thoughts from my self. I can observe them with more objectivity.</p>
<p>So showers are a space for thinking, but real thinking requires writing. Therefore, showers are a space for writing.</p>
<p>But <em>how</em> does one write in the shower?</p>
<p>I use <a href="https://www.myaquanotes.com/">Aqua Notes</a>.</p>

<h2 id="aqua-notes-has-changed-the-way-i-shower">Aqua Notes has changed the way I shower</h2>
<p>Some days I go into my shower with an idea I really need to think through: a complex challenge at work, a parenting dilemma, a tough conversation I need to have, etc. But on other days, I sleepily clamber into the shower and wait to see what rises to the surface of my mind while the warm water hits my back.</p>
<p>Regardless which kind of day I&rsquo;m having, having a paper pad in the shower gives me a way to externalize my inner dialog.</p>
<p>Whether I&rsquo;m showering with the intention of thinking or not, I always end up doing some thinking. The shower seems to have a unique capacity for shining a light on the recesses of my mind. Then the paper can capture the fleeting ideas that usually lie dormant in these recesses.</p>
<p>I have used Aqua notes to capture all sorts of shower thoughts, from random ideas, to poetry, to visuals. I want to tell you more about what Aqua Notes is, how I&rsquo;ve used it, and other things I tried before Aqua Notes.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-aqua-notes">What is Aqua Notes?</h2>
<p>Aqua Notes is a simple product. It is just a plasticky paper notepad, a pencil, and suction cups. It was founded by a guy that wanted to remember his shower thoughts, and all the component pieces are manufactured and assembled in the USA.</p>
<h3 id="the-pad">The Pad</h3>
<p>The paper in the pad is waterproof and has a very smooth texture. It is surprisingly easy to write on with pencil, even when wet!</p>
<p>I have not seen this advertised or discussed anywhere, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that each piece of paper can be ripped off and stuck to the wall by itself. It just takes a little water, and I&rsquo;ve never had a piece of paper fall off the wall from drying out. This lets me write on the reverse side of each paper and fill up my shower wall with notes like a mad scientist.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Being able to rip off pieces of paper also means that I can take my notes with me outside the shower if I need to.</p>
<p>The paper is a little difficult to rip cleanly (although it is perforated) so you have to be careful when pulling a page off the pad.</p>
<h3 id="the-pencil">The Pencil</h3>
<p>The pencil is a standard graphite pencil that needs to be sharpened occasionally. Inscribed on one side is the saying &ldquo;NO MORE GREAT IDEAS DOWN THE DRAIN!&rdquo;. It has an eraser, which works okay on the plasticky paper. It&rsquo;s not as easy to erase as standard paper, but not too difficult either.</p>
<p>The pencil has been great, and I love that it&rsquo;s a no-nonsense tool I can always expect to work. Unlike some of the <a href="#alternatives-ive-tried-for-capturing-shower-thoughts">other things I&rsquo;ve tried</a>&hellip;</p>
<h3 id="the-suction-cups">The Suction Cups</h3>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have much to say here other than that I have had no issues with these staying on the wall. That was something I was concerned about when I bought this, so I wanted to mention it for others wondering the same.</p>
<p>Now that you know what Aqua Notes is, you might be thinking &ldquo;but what would I actually write on there?&rdquo; The answer is: all sorts of things!</p>
<h2 id="what-i-write-in-the-shower">What I write in the shower</h2>
<h3 id="tasks">Tasks</h3>
<p>I used to think of something I needed to do while showering, and then would forget it right after.</p>
<p>Now I can write down any pesky to-dos that come up during my shower. After I shower, I&rsquo;ll take a look at my notes and transfer any tasks into my phone or elsewhere.</p>
<h3 id="random-thoughts">Random thoughts</h3>
<p>Some random thoughts are worth capturing. This could be a spontaneous idea for a product, self-reflection about how I am living my life, or anything in between.</p>
<h3 id="intentional-thoughts">Intentional thoughts</h3>
<p>Occasionally I&rsquo;ll give my shower a goal. In these cases there&rsquo;s a very specific thing I need to think through, so I will use my shower as a chunk of dedicated time to work through it. I write through each step of the process and work out my thoughts methodically.</p>
<h3 id="podcast-notes">Podcast notes</h3>
<p>Sometimes I listen to a podcast while I&rsquo;m in the shower, so I will write down any memorable quotes. I also write down my own notes about impactful ideas I want to remember.</p>
<h3 id="visuals">Visuals</h3>
<p>Many thoughts are better captured in a visual rather than words. I might be trying to work through a complex topic, or there might just be an image in my brain that I want to hold onto for later.</p>
<p>I love that the empty pad gives my notes the flexibility to take whatever form they need.</p>
<h3 id="haiku">Haiku</h3>
<p>I enjoy writing haiku occasionally. I use it as a way to capture an idea in short, memorable prose.</p>
<h3 id="love-notes-for-my-wife">Love notes for my wife</h3>
<p>Short shower notes are a sweet, thoughtful surprise that I use to lift up my wife.</p>
<h2 id="alternatives-ive-tried-for-capturing-shower-thoughts">Alternatives I&rsquo;ve tried for capturing shower thoughts</h2>
<p>Before Aqua Notes, I had tried to perfect the art of capturing shower thoughts. My previous attempts had revolved around using technology, but they all fell short. I had assumed digital capture would be better because it would be quicker and easier to retrieve my notes. But I found all the digital options to be unreliable and have come to appreciate the way that the slowness of handwriting allows me to simmer in my thoughts.</p>
<h3 id="smartwatch">Smartwatch</h3>
<p>I thought for sure the smartwatch would be the answer. I could dictate my notes into my watch and then have them seamlessly uploaded to the cloud for safekeeping and retrieval later. But this didn&rsquo;t play out in reality the same way that I dreamt it up.</p>
<p>For one, dictation into my watch (Galaxy Watch 5) sucked. It was bad outside the shower, but inside the shower with all the noise I could rarely get it to capture a single sentence correctly.</p>
<p>I also ran into an issue with the apps I tried to use to capture notes. I tried Google Keep and the recording app that came on the watch. The recording app would just randomly shut off in the middle of me talking, which was irritating. And I think something similar happened with Google Keep, although I can&rsquo;t quite remember.</p>
<p>And don&rsquo;t even get me started on interacting with the watch screen while it was wet.</p>
<p>Maybe an Apple Watch could do better, but my Galaxy Watch was NOT a good shower notes companion.</p>
<h3 id="alexa">Alexa</h3>
<p>I also tried setting an Amazon Echo Dot right outside the shower so I could shout notes to it, but it did a poor job capturing what I said as well. It was also pretty annoying to try shouting outside the shower, or opening the door and poking my head out each time I had a thought.</p>
<h3 id="phone">Phone</h3>
<p>When I got frustrated with my watch, I tried using my phone for a little while, but that was destined for failure because I was too scared to get it near the water. It was hard to interact with if my hands were wet, and voice commands didn&rsquo;t work out too well for me.</p>
<p>After going through all of these iterations of digital tools, I realized that sometimes the simplest tools are the most powerful.</p>
<h2 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2>
<p><strong>Writing</strong> is great for <strong>thinking</strong> is great for <strong>showering</strong>. So writing is great for showering.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been amazed at the insights I&rsquo;ve captured while in the shower. It brings me joy to see an idea from a shower months ago that sparks new thought patterns in me today.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.myaquanotes.com/">Aqua Notes</a> is the best tool I&rsquo;ve found for thinking and writing in the shower. It&rsquo;s simple but effective. It can flex to accommodate two-word ideas, long chains of thoughts, visuals, and everything in between. Though flashier digital tools like smartwatches and automated home assistants seemed better, I&rsquo;ve found pencil and paper to be the best tool for the job.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say we spend 15 minutes in the shower daily. That&rsquo;s roughly 91 <em>hours</em> in a year. Getting clean is a noble enough way to spend that time, but I&rsquo;d encourage you to also intentionally think and write.</p>
<p>Pay attention to your thoughts and emotions. What comes up might be important. And the important things should be captured, not washed down the drain.</p>

<h3 id="dad-stuff">Dad Stuff</h3>
<p>My daughter is walking! She is almost 15 months old now, and it feels like overnight she transformed from baby to toddler. Crawling to walking took a couple of months, but I think she went from walking to running in an hour. We&rsquo;re chasing her all over the place now. This is such a fun age.</p>
<p>In addition to walking/running, she&rsquo;s getting pretty good at sign language and a few words. Her favorite words right now are dada, mama, baby, blueberries (besbes), bees, go (doe), bottle (baba), wheels on the bus (wuhbuh), book (buhbuh), dog (wohwoh, because our dog&rsquo;s name is Lolo), bye bye, thank you and ball. She&rsquo;s also gotten very good at shaking her head &ldquo;no&rdquo;, and is not afraid to use it. This girl has some sass. It can be challenging, but I am proud that we are encouraging her sense of self and being assertive about her needs even at this young age.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m having a lot of fun spending time with my daughter and playing with her. She is sweet and pure in a way that starkly contrasts the messiness and hustle of the world. She loves giving kisses and hugs. I love watching her walk around kissing her stuffed animals, and then offering them up to me or my wife to kiss them too. I want to soak in every moment I can with her.</p>
<p>And yet&hellip; if I&rsquo;m being completely honest, I find myself having a desire to check out sometimes. My wife and I are working to keep each other accountable to not turning to our phones when we&rsquo;re tired. I know I will be so much happier if I stay present in the moment, but the siren call of distraction can be really strong. I can easily fall into binging articles or videos and justifying it as &ldquo;learning&rdquo;, but it&rsquo;s just my way of turning off to the hard things in front of me.</p>
<h3 id="creating">Creating</h3>
<p>I continue to blog infrequently but love it when I do it. It seems li ke my creative energy comes in waves, and it has been on the upswing recently. I went the whole month of July without posting any articles, but wrote a handful last month. Recently, I redesigned the <a href="https://weidok.al/">homepage</a> of my blog and am pretty happy with how it turned out. I like just seeing a listing of all the things I&rsquo;ve written about, and I imagine that&rsquo;s what others would be interested in too.</p>
<p>A while ago I liked the idea of writing think piece articles where I do a bunch of research to from a novel opinion on a topic of interest, but that hasn&rsquo;t materialized yet. I think maybe it&rsquo;s just not my style? So far, my process is that I get super obsessed with an idea of something I want to write, and I need to get it out of my system within 24 hours. Then I publish it with little to no editing. I&rsquo;m not sure that there&rsquo;s a right or wrong way, but I&rsquo;d still like to at least experiment with a more patient approach to writing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also been working on <a href="https://www.fedmeetup.com/">Fed Meetup</a> more. I had to update it with the FY25 rates that got posted by GSA recently, and while I was in there I cleaned up the interface. There&rsquo;s still a lot of room for improvement, but it&rsquo;s getting better. The worst part about the app right now is the initial load time. It&rsquo;s atrocious, but I&rsquo;m still figuring out how to get things to render correctly and lazy load in SvelteKit. That&rsquo;s the next thing I plan to tackle.</p>
<p>I have ideas for all sorts of other things I&rsquo;d like to create and put together an <a href="https://weidok.al/ideas">ideas page</a> to keep track of them.</p>
<h3 id="work">Work</h3>
<p>My big focuses right now are the NASA Cause Analysis Tool (NCAT) and the NASA Mishap Information System (NMIS). NCAT was the first app that managed from idea all the way to release, and it was released earlier this year. It has been successful so far, and is getting good feedback from the mishap investigator community at NASA. These are the main people using the tool currently, it helps them brainstorm and organize data to determine findings and recommendations as part of their investigations.</p>
<p>NMIS is one of the NASA Safety Center&rsquo;s oldest applications and I recently to over as the product manager for it. It is the source of truth for all NASA mishap data. It is a big legacy app and has a very different feel from NCAT, which is our newest application. NMIS is going through major changes right now since the mishap policy at NASA is changing, and the software needs to change with the policy. It has been fun getting up to speed on NMIS quickly and thinking about how we will implement major changes that touch most parts of the application.</p>
<h3 id="faith-and-friends">Faith and Friends</h3>
<p>The church group my wife and I are a part of has become completely overrun with babies&hellip; When we joined a couple of years ago, there were 0, and now we are well into double digits. We&rsquo;ve all started going in on childcare together, and that has improved the dynamic of the group a lot. It&rsquo;s a lot easier to have deep, meaningful conversation when there aren&rsquo;t a bunch of kids toddling around and screaming.</p>
<p>I feel like my attitude toward my faith has been apathetic for a while, and I&rsquo;m not sure what to do about it. I believe in Christ as my savior, and I believe God is active in my life and with me, but that doesn&rsquo;t impact my heart as much as it used to. This concerns me. I feel a dissonance between my mind and my heart. It makes me wonder if I have allowed myself to get too comfortable? Am I settling for a typical American middle class life, concerned more with status and self-satisfaction than with the grand question of why I am even here? How could I not be moved by my belief that the reason I am here is to honor God and share love with others? I am praying for God to reignite my passion and excitement, but I am still waiting. That is okay, it does not shake the foundation of my faith, but I do feel like I am in a dry valley.</p>
<p>And despite all of these existential questions, I don&rsquo;t want things to change. I really like my comfortable American life. I may be holding onto it too tightly. If I was asked to give it up, I would have a really hard time with that. It puts me in a weird place. I don&rsquo;t really want change, but I am hoping and praying for it.</p>
<h3 id="leisure">Leisure</h3>
<p>I finished the Foundation Series by Isaac Aasimov, and now I am reading a couple different books: Ghost Soldiers, Thus Spake Zarathustra, and Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been disc golfing occasionally when I can and have been playing really well. I played my highest rated round ever couple of days ago.</p>
<h3 id="exercise">Exercise</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been doing a couple sets a day of push-ups to failure, and that has been excellent for me. I&rsquo;ve struggled with making time to go to the gym or even do a full workout at time, and this is so stupid easy that I&rsquo;ve actually been able to keep up with it. I focus on going slow so that I use not just my arms but also my core.</p>
<p>My wife and I also recently got memberships to our local YMCA. We&rsquo;ve gone a couple of times, but I&rsquo;m not sure if we&rsquo;ll stick with it. The place just has a weird feel. I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s too dark, or has a weird smell, but something is just off. I really want to do CrossFit or some sort of other group class like Jiu Jitsu, but those are so expensive that they&rsquo;re tough to justify. They also feel like a little more of a time commitment, but I think that would be good for me. I think commitment is what I need.</p>
<h3 id="home">Home</h3>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been rearranging the house quite a bit. It ended up in a weird setup, so I think we&rsquo;re going to rearrange it all again soon. We&rsquo;re trying to figure out how to have a nice adult space that is also kid-friendly.</p>
<p>Also, we had 5 different contractors come out recently to give us quotes for a back patio. We&rsquo;re looking forward to making our backyard a nice space to entertain friends and let all the kids roam around.</p>

<p>I wish I would have known that there was no need to wait. I went to college. I went to law school. I worked in law and banking, though not for terribly long. But not until I started PayPal did I fully realize that you don’t have to wait to start something. So if you’re planning to do something with your life, if you have a 10-year plan of how to get there, you should ask: Why can’t you do this in 6 months? Sometimes, you have to actually go through the complex, 10-year trajectory. But it’s at least worth asking whether that’s the story you’re telling yourself, or whether that’s the reality.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s never a clear path! My path has been all over the place, and I never would have guessed I would be where I am now.</p>
<p>I think the key is to do the best you can where you are and always be on the lookout for new opportunities. Reach higher than you think you can go and ignore the requirements in job postings, they&rsquo;re just wish lists.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t expect to get the job I have now. I was terribly underqualified on paper, and just wanted to apply to see what the interview process might be like for the kind of position I might apply for in a few years. And then I got the job!</p>
<p>Also, have fun along the way. If you&rsquo;re early on in your career, look for fun ways that you can boost your visibility and increase your surface area for lucky opportunities. For me, that looks like posting on LinkedIn, starting a blog, working on web apps on the side, etc. Just find stuff you love related to where you want to go, and start now. Find little aerospace projects to work on, or AI projects, or local leadership opportunities.</p>
<p>You got this!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I want to capture this in a post so I can share it with anyone else struggling with the same things. Demotivation like this is really common and I&rsquo;ve dealt with it too.</p>
<p>To anyone else out there struggling with the same thing, you really do got this! Keep moving, keep having fun, and tell people about what you&rsquo;re doing. The right opportunity will come along!</p>
<p>I would be happy to chat over <a href="mailto:jake@weidok.al?subject=Re:%20Advice%20To%20A%20Demotivated%20Job%20Seeker">email</a> about it!</p>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s the beautiful easing into dawn as I write. I&rsquo;m sitting in a rocking chair on the chapel deck, overlooking one of New York&rsquo;s finger lakes. In the middle of the quiet and solitude, a speedboat just ripped across the lake as I finished that last sentence. It&rsquo;s 6:50 a.m. I was up at 5:00, woken by my daughter crying. My back hurts and my neck aches from sleeping on the hard wooden bunk bed of the camp cabin we&rsquo;re staying in.</p>
<p>Despite the aches, pains, and upset baby, I am at peace. My soul is at ease in the morning light over the lake. Now that my wife and daughter have gone back to bed, the seagulls are my only companions.</p>
<p>I had started reading Nietzsche but had to put it down. It&rsquo;s just too&hellip; depressing. Too depressing for the goodness of this moment. Which is ironic, because he was talking about the need for solitude and nature. But he was discussing that need as it relates to all the &ldquo;blood-sucking poison-flies&rdquo; that we encounter in our interactions with other people. Sure, the &ldquo;blood-sucking poison-flies&rdquo; are out there, but I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re as pervasive as Nietzsche thinks. And even if they were, that&rsquo;s not what I want on my mind right now.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited for Mikenna and Josh getting married this afternoon. Though it can be stressful, I enjoy the excited energy of being around the wedding party in the days leading up to the wedding.</p>
<p>I used to think weddings were silly. A flashy &ldquo;look at me&rdquo; beginning to a lifelong commitment. I still think they are overemphasized in our culture, but I see the value in them now. Bringing people together and having grand celebrations helps everyone process and incorporate big life changes. This is true also for funerals, grad parties, and other traditional celebration/events for big life changes.</p>
<p>While a wedding is <em>about</em> the bride and groom, it is <em>for</em> everyone. As the attendees at a wedding, we get a shared experience of the start of the couple&rsquo;s journey. We show our support for the couple, and we strengthen bonds with each other, further strengthening the couple&rsquo;s support network. We are reminded of love. We are reminded that love is worth celebrating. We get to be part of a sacred covenant. Hopefully, we put aside our selfish aims for a day and allow the spotlight to be on the couple.</p>
<p>Maybe most importantly, we pause. We recognize that there are things in life worth pausing for. And the greatest of these is love.</p>

			 <p>I have a tendency to be consumed by a niche interest or hobby every now and then. In the past it&rsquo;s been disc golf, counter strike, yo-yoing, hot sauces, coffee, apologetics, and even card magic. Now I&rsquo;m introducing the latest interest that my free-time has fallen victim to: indie hacking.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-indie-hacking">What is Indie Hacking?</h2>
<p>Despite having &ldquo;hacking&rdquo; in the name, indie hacking is not nearly as nefarious as it seems. It does not involve late night attempts to crack the access code to a terminal while 80s synth wave music surges in the background.</p>
<p>Indie hacking is building software products without a large team and without investments from venture capitalists. Many indie hackers set up their businesses as &ldquo;lifestyle businesses&rdquo;, which means that they optimize for time freedom instead of financial growth. So instead of hiring a bigger team to grow the business to infinity and beyond, an indie hacker might set up process automations to make their business run on autopilot so that they can have more time in their day.</p>
<h2 id="my-introduction-to-indie-hacking">My Introduction to Indie Hacking</h2>
<p>I started down this rabbit hole after listening to <a href="%5Bhttps://lexfridman.com/pieter-levels-transcript/%5D(https://lexfridman.com/pieter-levels-transcript/)">Lex Fridman&rsquo;s podcast with guest Pieter Levels.</a> Pieter is notorious in the indie hacker community, and has set up several lifestyle businesses for himself, such as <a href="https://nomads.com/">nomads.com</a>. After being inspired by his journey, I took a look at <a href="%5Bhttps://levels.io/blog/%5D(https://levels.io/blog/)">his blog</a> and a couple of his posts gave me more to look into:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://levels.io/startups/">https://levels.io/startups/</a> - how to take an idea from 0 to 100</li>
<li><a href="https://levels.io/copywriting/">https://levels.io/copywriting/</a> - dead simple advice for writing good copy</li>
<li><a href="https://levels.io/hoodmaps/">https://levels.io/hoodmaps/</a> - a crazy long post documenting how Pieter built an app from the first line of code to being complete</li>
</ul>
<p>Looking at these posts then led me to <a href="%5Bhttps://news.ycombinator.com/show%5D(https://news.ycombinator.com/show)">Show Hacker News</a>, <a href="%5Bhttps://www.indiehackers.com/starting-up%5D(https://www.indiehackers.com/starting-up)">Indie Hackers</a>, and <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/">Product Hunt</a>. <a href="%5Bhttps://news.ycombinator.com/show%5D(https://news.ycombinator.com/show)">Show Hacker News</a> is a great place to see what other people are building and to see how the &ldquo;hacker community&rdquo; responds. <a href="%5Bhttps://www.indiehackers.com/starting-up%5D(https://www.indiehackers.com/starting-up)">Indie Hackers</a> has all sorts of articles and resources with info on getting started. They also have a podcast I just stumbled on today! I had never heard of <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/">Product Hunt</a> before, but it&rsquo;s a place where each day new apps get launched and then voted on. The most popular apps rise to the top, so for the early-adopter community it is a way to see what hot new apps are available, and for makers it is a great way to get visibility and users for a new product.</p>
<h2 id="what-indie-hacking-means-to-me">What Indie Hacking Means To Me</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been inspired by all the stories I&rsquo;ve read and the products I&rsquo;ve seen. My day job is fun and rewarding, but it has become removed from coding. I miss the tight feedback loop of having a small feature in my head to build and then bringing it to life. To reconcile that, I&rsquo;m moonlighting as an indie hacker. I have no grand monetization scheme, no clearly laid out plan, and little free time as a new dad working a full-time job. But I&rsquo;m building nonetheless. My latest creation is <a href="http://fedmeetup.com/">fedmeetup.com</a>, and I just pushed some new updates to it over the last week.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still a bit embarrassed by how wonky the interface looks (need to work on my design skills) but I&rsquo;m trying to embrace the indie hacker mantra of &ldquo;ship early, ship often&rdquo;. Fed Meetup solves a problem (Where should I host a federal in-person event to maximize savings of taxpayer dollars?) in its current form, so I&rsquo;ve released it into the wild and will build it alongside those using it. I know of at least a couple of people at NASA who have started using it and I plan to broadcast it more widely through NASA. Once it has had success at NASA, I&rsquo;ll start outreach to other agencies.</p>
<p>On top of Fed Meetup, I have other ideas that I&rsquo;m itching to build:</p>
<ol>
<li>I want to make an app for prayer that combines the best elements of Duolingo and Readwise. I often tell people I will pray for them and then forget, so I want to build something that solves that. A place I can store the things I want to be praying for, that also reminds me to pray and maybe even has some gamification to encourage me to keep engaging with my prayers.</li>
<li>I also want to make a quick capture app. What I really want to make is a widget for an android or iPhone, that makes it dead simple to capture quick notes and have a running log of these quick notes. I haven&rsquo;t found a satisfying solution for this yet.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve also considered writing a weekly email newsletter that either has a paid subscription option or a donate option. It would have to be something that provides value&hellip; I was thinking either &ldquo;hacks&rdquo; for the average office user to use their computer better, or a weekly interview with someone who works at NASA, highlighting the person and their work.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is just the beginning of my ideas, so I&rsquo;m going to create an /ideas page on this blog to store all of them. I want to share these publicly partly for accountability and partly because I think they need to be built, so I welcome others to build them too! If you have any interesting ideas you think we could work on together, I would love to hear them.</p>
<h2 id="the-piece-im-missing">The Piece I&rsquo;m Missing</h2>
<p>The main way I differ from other indie hackers is that I don&rsquo;t have an intense focus on monetization. I&rsquo;m more of an indie hobbyist, who may one day metamorphose from hobbyist to hacker. Indie hackers are usually very focused on their Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) which is the key measure for a subscription based business. After reviewing my financial situation, my MRR between my blog and Fed Meetup is -$7. I pay $5/mo for blog hosting, and about $1/mo each for my domain names. And none of this is pulling in any money.</p>
<p>For now, I am content with that. I&rsquo;m enjoying the craft of both writing and building software products. It brings me immense joy to write these blog posts and to build things like Fed Meetup. However, I do dream of a day when the side projects I&rsquo;ve built over time could support my family financially. I am quite happy supporting my family through my W-2 job, but I am attracted to the romanticized freedom that having my own business(es) would afford. I know it won&rsquo;t be all sunshine and rainbows, but I think it would fit my personality well.</p>
<p>In my mind, the key to all of this is experimentation. This is not a big announcement of a shift in focus or career for me. Rather, this is me sharing a potential future path that I plan to experiment with. I plan to start small with my hobbyist projects, giving some more thought to how I can monetize them. Actually, I&rsquo;m quite excited about experimenting with monetization and value. Stories like the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/lessonsfromthepast-how-swinmurns-wizard-oz-birthed-obasi-aca--hp69e/">Zappos founder</a>, Nick Swinmurn, fuel my imagination. He set up an online shoe store before having any inventory. While he was validating the company&rsquo;s value proposition (would people buy shoes online without trying them on?), he would receive orders and then go out himself to local shoe stores to buy shoes and ship them out. Finding opportunities for this kind of &ldquo;Wizard of Oz&rdquo; testing to validate business viability is exciting and fun to me.</p>
<p>So why am I sharing all of this? Because you can expect to hear more from me about what I&rsquo;m building. <a href="https://whop.com/blog/building-in-public-guide/">Building in public</a> is about authentically sharing the journey from idea to product. I hope to do just that and I invite you to join me and follow along.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been feeling like my home page wasn&rsquo;t what I really wanted people&rsquo;s first experience with my blog to be. I want people to be able to get a high-level overview of what I write about and what my interests are. I admire other blogs that just have a list of long-form articles, so I decided to update my home page to work similarly.</p>
<p>Check out my new home page at <a href="/">weidok.al</a></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>For anyone else using the Micro.blog Tiny Theme that wants to do the same, here is how I did it:</p>
<h2 id="instructions">Instructions</h2>
<p><em>Warning: Keep in mind that this is one of the more power <a href="https://tiny.micro.blog/microhooks/">microhooks</a> in the Tiny Theme, so it may override other microhooks you have already set up</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure Tiny Theme is installed on the Plug-ins page</li>
<li>create a custom theme (or edit your existing custom theme if you already have one)</li>
<li>add the following page to your theme: layouts/partials/microhook-post-list.html</li>
<li>in that page, add the code below:</li>
</ul>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>&lt;div class=&quot;home h-feed&quot;&gt;
  {{ $posts := where .Site.RegularPages &quot;Type&quot; &quot;post&quot; }}
  {{ $articles := where $posts &quot;Title&quot; &quot;!=&quot; &quot;&quot; }}
  
  {{ range $articles.GroupByDate &quot;2006&quot; }}
    &lt;h2&gt;{{ .Key }}&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;ul class=&quot;post-list&quot;&gt;
      {{ range .Pages }}
        &lt;li class=&quot;h-entry&quot; style=&quot;padding: 0.5em 0;&quot;&gt;
            &lt;div style=&quot;display: flex;&quot;&gt;

                        {{ .Date.Format &quot;Jan 02&quot; }}
                    &lt;/time&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div style=&quot;flex-grow: 1; min-width: 0;&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;a href=&quot;{{ .Permalink }}&quot; style=&quot;word-wrap: break-word; overflow-wrap: break-word;&quot;&gt;{{ .Title }}&lt;/a&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/li&gt;
      {{ end }}
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  {{ end }}
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre><ul>
<li>save the template</li>

<p>And voila! Just like that, you&rsquo;ve updated your homepage to show a list of reverse chronological posts, but only showing long-form articles grouped by the year.</p>

			 <p>Today I found myself in the downtown area of an old, little rural Ohio town. Surrounded by brick buildings, with a large, antiquated concrete community bank on the opposite corner. I stopped in at a local Chinese takeout place with my family for lunch. We ordered our food, and were told the customary &ldquo;10 minutes&rdquo;. While waiting for them to prepare our food, I stepped out onto the corner with my daughter.</p>
<p>It was&hellip; unremarkable. Another typical Ohio day in a quaint Ohio town.</p>
<p>But doing unremarkable things with a one year-old can suddenly make them remarkable.</p>
<p>My daughter stared in amazement at the cars going by, talking and waving to each one. She looked one way down the sidewalk and squealed, then turned around quickly and squealed in the other direction. She looked up and squinted as the sun shone on her face and the wind blew her bangs around.</p>
<p>And then strangely, I began to see and hear what was around me. I suppose I am always doing this, but there was something special about being acutely <em>aware</em> of my seeing and my hearing.</p>
<p>I suddenly saw the cars not as background movement, but as amazing marvels of engineering, each unique from the next. I saw the people in them. I saw how focused they were. I imagined their destination, their origin, their goals, their lives. Each so focused on their own. As I usually am.</p>
<p>I saw the buildings around me. I imagined their history. The tenants that each had their moment in the space. The decades of daily visitors passing in and out.</p>
<p>I saw the stop lights. Their simple design. Their rigid schedule. Easily understood.</p>
<p>I smelled the scent of the Chinese restaurant wafting out the door behind me. I heard construction in the distance and cars whooshing by. I felt on my back the gritty texture of the concrete pillar that I leaned against.</p>
<p>I felt what my daughter felt. Not with touch, but with my whole self. I stepped into her joy and her excitement. I looked into her eyes and giggled with her. I squealed at the sidewalk. I waved at the cars.</p>
<p>I transformed from agent to observer. I had no goal in that moment. I simply observed. It was nice. I felt like a little fly on the wall of my tiny corner of the universe, watching time and space move around me.</p>
<p>Usually I move through the world as if I <em>am</em> the universe. My thoughts blind me from what is around me. My thoughts seem to be all that exists. It&rsquo;s a lot being the universe. It&rsquo;s relaxing to not be the universe. To merely be part of it. Especially if you can be part of it with someone you love.</p>
<p>So grab someone you love and go stand on a street corner and look around.</p>

			 <p>I recently had 35 meetings in a week. This is a lot, but not uncommon for employees of large enterprises. While it is easy to lament an organization&rsquo;s &ldquo;meeting culture&rdquo;, there are also actions individual employees can take to reduce their meeting load. I recognized that attending all the meetings on my calendar was not possible (one time slot was quadruple-booked!) so I developed the following approach for responding to meetings.</p>
<p>When a new meeting comes up I figure out what my role will be in the meeting and then decide whether I will attend based on my role.</p>
<h2 id="meeting-roles">Meeting Roles</h2>
<h4 id="1-facilitating">1. Facilitating</h4>
<p>I record my meetings when appropriate. I make sure someone is taking notes, if not me. I send a follow-up email with actions, key info, and notes.</p>
<h4 id="2-contributing">2. Contributing</h4>
<p>If I believe I can benefit the meeting purpose or myself, I will attend and contribute. I send a follow-up email with actions, key info, and notes if I don&rsquo;t think the facilitator will.</p>
<h4 id="3-listening">3. Listening</h4>
<p>Do not attend. Ask for notes and/or watch the recording.</p>
<h2 id="process-for-reviewing-informational-meetings">Process for Reviewing Informational Meetings</h2>
<p>For informational (listening) meetings, I skip them whenever I can. If it is recorded, I can watch the recording on my own time at 1.5x or 2x speed and I can skip around as needed to parts that are relevant to me. If it will not be recorded, I can ask someone else who is attending to take notes for me. If it is not recorded and nobody can take notes, I practice gratitude for not needing to review another meeting and I consider the fact that I don&rsquo;t need to know <em>everything</em>. 🙂</p>
<ul>
<li>Each week, for meetings I plan to skip but want to follow up on, I mark them as &ldquo;free&rdquo; in outlook and categorize them in my &ldquo;Skip&rdquo; category. If unsure whether I will attend, I will mark it as tentative but still put it in the &ldquo;Skip&rdquo; category.</li>
<li>At the end of the week, I open the &ldquo;meet&rdquo; tab in Teams and filter by recorded meetings. I review recordings of meetings I missed in the last week.</li>
</ul>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<ul>
<li>For meetings that were not recorded, I go into Outlook, open the calendar, and type &ldquo;Skip&rdquo; into the search bar. This brings up all the meetings I marked as &ldquo;Skip&rdquo;. If there are any meetings I want to follow up on, I reach out to the organizer or another attendee to ask for their notes.</li>
</ul>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Following this process is helping me to reduce my meeting burden without missing relevant information. I recognize meetings can be important, but I am mindful to weigh their value against my priorities and my organization&rsquo;s priorities.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://weidok.al/2024/06/30/pieces-of-advice.html">26 Pieces Of Advice To My Past Self</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://weidok.al/2024/06/30/pieces-of-advice.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2024-06-30 07:16:43 -0500">Jun 30, 2024</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I recently turned 26. I&rsquo;m no sage, but I&rsquo;ve picked up a couple of lessons in my time. Below are 26 things I would tell a younger me if I could.</p>
<p><strong>1</strong> Read more material that endures. Posts and videos are ephemeral. They come and go. Seek out knowledge and stories that have survived years, decades, or centuries.</p>
<p><strong>2</strong> Write as much as you can. Write anything. Document your days. You&rsquo;ll love flipping through old journal entries, and seeing what you were doing. Trap your anxious and messy thoughts on paper, so they don&rsquo;t consume your mind. When confronted with something hard, think through it in writing. It will slow you down, and allow you to evaluate your thoughts more clearly.</p>
<p><strong>3</strong> You have an aversion to conflict. You can feel it in your bones. That&rsquo;s okay. Stay in it, and realize there are many ways to work through conflict. Guide the conflict into a style that you do well with. Conflict can be important, so do not avoid it when it is necessary. Stay calm and explain yourself clearly, even if you need to tremble through it.</p>
<p><strong>4</strong> You have a guilty conscience. This is good because it means you have a sense of morality but beware of people who will try to use that against you. If someone or something is making you feel guilty, pay close attention to the motives.</p>
<p><strong>5</strong> Smile, make eye contact, and when you ask someone how they are, really ask them.</p>
<p><strong>6</strong> The world is lonely without a community that shares your values. As soon as you realize you do not have this, find it. Or make it.</p>
<p><strong>7</strong> You can become a good public speaker. Like conflict, you feel like you need to run from it, but the truth is you must do exactly the opposite. Seek out opportunities to speak in front of others. It will be uncomfortable, but the more you do it, the better you will get. And absolutely practice beforehand, winging it is a terrible idea.</p>
<p><strong>8</strong> Stay open. Much of the good in your life will come from opportunities you didn&rsquo;t foresee at all and had no control over. You might miss them if you keep too tight a grip on what you think you need.</p>
<p><strong>9</strong> Related to the above, don&rsquo;t forget how much you owe to God and luck. You think you know this, but you cannot comprehend its depth.</p>
<p><strong>10</strong> Remember that every lie you tell will be accompanied by a confession, or worse, an exposure. Think of this anytime you consider lying, and do not do it. Lying is like smoking, it builds up tar in your soul.</p>
<p><strong>11</strong> Remember that it&rsquo;s temporary. In the midst of anxiety, it will feel all-consuming and never-ending. It isn&rsquo;t so. It will end.</p>
<p><strong>12</strong> Everybody is fascinating if you ask. So ask, then listen.</p>
<p><strong>13</strong> Initiate connection in your marriage daily. It will not initiate itself.</p>
<p><strong>14</strong> Step up and lead. Getting everyone&rsquo;s opinion and deciding by majority may feel inclusive, but it is not leading. You will need to make tough, uncomfortable, and even unpopular calls. Make them and then bear them.</p>
<p><strong>15</strong> You so desire to be better that you will have a tendency to believe all feedback you receive. Some feedback is neither valid nor helpful. Don&rsquo;t get stirred up over it. Recognize it for what it is, and move on.</p>
<p><strong>16</strong> Say what you want. Especially to your managers at work. People don&rsquo;t know what you want if you don&rsquo;t tell them. Most people will try to help you get what you want if they know what it is.</p>
<p><strong>17</strong> Never disbelieve in what you are capable of. You will learn to love olives. And you will become a master diaper changer. If you can do those, you can do anything.</p>
<p><strong>18</strong> Nourish your curiosity. You do a good job of exploring new things and not caring so much if others think they&rsquo;re weird. In fact, relish in the confused gaze you get when you tell people about your new abstract hobby or interest. Keep doing that.</p>
<p><strong>19</strong> You follow rules really well. Try breaking them more.</p>
<p><strong>20</strong> Just because everyone is doing it, does not mean it&rsquo;s good for you. You are allowed to completely cut yourself off from things that are not good for you.</p>
<p><strong>21</strong> Don&rsquo;t get too obsessed with being better or doing better. You&rsquo;ll lose sight of now, which is bad because it&rsquo;s always now. Be present. Accept what is.</p>
<p><strong>22</strong> Start developing habits to maintain your health. Your high metabolism will not last forever, and avoiding the doctor will only cause more problems later. Get a primary care physician, see a dermatologist, and keep up with the dentist.</p>
<p><strong>23</strong> Don&rsquo;t be ashamed of your age. People use age as a proxy for competence and trustworthiness, so these assumptions will not be given to you easily. Be honest about who you are, and what you are, and lean into your strengths. Wherever you are, you are there for a reason, even if you feel out of place.</p>
<p><strong>24</strong> Please take yourself less seriously. Not everything needs to be about &ldquo;finding signal&rdquo; or doing better. Have fun and be goofy. Don&rsquo;t forget how to take it easy, this seems to get a little harder for you each year.</p>
<p><strong>25</strong> Go to bed earlier and wake up earlier. It&rsquo;s amazing how much better life feels this way.</p>
<p><strong>26</strong> Be less selfish. Think of others more, and make a system to do so if it does not come naturally.</p>

			 <p><em>The following is a message I shared with my organization today.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>In light of NASA&rsquo;s push to train up the workforce on AI, I wanted to share a tool that I&rsquo;ve been using in my day-to-day. This is a simple tool that would be a good introduction for folks who haven&rsquo;t been using AI much.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.perplexity.ai/">Perplexity AI</a> is a conversational AI assistant and search engine that provides citations for sources it is using. You can also specify whether you want it to only search through academic journals, Reddit, or other sources.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using this about as much as I&rsquo;ve been searching for links with Google. I&rsquo;ve been using it for research, learning new things, troubleshooting other tools I use at work, etc. The cited sources help me to see where the answer is coming from, to judge whether I should trust it or not. And it&rsquo;s really easy to use. Just type in a question you want an answer to, and it will give you cited responses.</p>
<p>A lot of the other big LLMs are good too, and each have there own strengths and weaknesses. Perplexity would be happy to tell you what they are!</p>
<p>Some others I&rsquo;ve tried are:</p>
<ul>
<li>ChatGPT, from Open AI: <a href="https://chatgpt.com/">https://chatgpt.com/ </a></li>
<li>Gemini, from Google: <a href="https://gemini.google.com/">https://gemini.google.com/  </a></li>

			 <p><em>I would like to note that as I write this, I am not following the advice contained within whatsoever.</em></p>
<p>I want to write better articles. I want to use them to reason and think. I would like to do <em>some</em> research and link to sources, so that my articles have some ground to stand on and they provide real value.</p>
<p>To this end, I&rsquo;ve been doing some research on writing a good article and I made the cheat sheet below for myself. I don&rsquo;t plan to follow this dogmatically, but it will help me remember what to focus on in different stages of my writing. The following is primarily a reframing of the essay app&rsquo;s <a href="https://essay.app/guide">writing guide</a>, because its advice resonated with me the most of what I found online.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-write-a-kickass-article">How to Write a Kickass Article</h3>
<ol>
<li>Read to get ideas.
<ul>
<li>Books</li>
<li>Articles</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Give yourself plenty of time to write.</li>
<li>Make an outline to start.
<ul>
<li>Shoot for 10ish bullets. Any bigger and it is hard to see the flow of the argument.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Write a bad draft - remember <em>producing and editing</em> are different activities.
<ul>
<li>Produce, produce, produce.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Write more than you think you need, then chop it down.</li>
<li>Edit it.
<ol>
<li>Rewrite every sentence.</li>
<li>Reorder until it makes sense.</li>
<li>Reread the whole thing.</li>
<li>Refine, refine, refine.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Create a new outline - Try reconstructing your argument from memory. What you remember is the good stuff. The rest might be crap. Ponder that.</li>
<li>Cut and paste from your old outline into the new one.</li>
<li>Make sure you have hyperlinks in the text for citations.</li>

			 <p>My new shipment from <a href="https://www.gouletpens.com/">The Goulet Pen Company</a> makes it feel like Christmas!</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I ordered their <a href="https://www.gouletpens.com/collections/all-paper/products/notebook-sampler-package-set#">notebook sampler</a> and got a <a href="https://www.gouletpens.com/collections/random-ink-sample-set/products/ink-sample-package-surprise-me#">random ink sample set</a> for free.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve barely tested the notebooks so far, but I&rsquo;m <em>really</em> liking the Goulet notebook with Tomoe River paper. It felt silky smooth and the lines of the ink were the most crisp I&rsquo;ve seen. All the notebooks seem great though. I&rsquo;m going to have fun trying them out!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a little bummed that the Goulet notebook came in the pocket size instead of the passport size, because I use a passport size traveler&rsquo;s notebook as a pocket journal/wallet. In the future, I think I&rsquo;ll be buying the Tomoe River refills instead of the standard Traveler&rsquo;s Notebook (TN) refills. Although TN paper is from Midori and is quite nice too. I found that the TN paper was the most toothy of the notebooks in the sampler.</p>
<p>The notebooks all have &ldquo;premium&rdquo; paper ideal for fountain pens, and include:</p>

<li><a href="https://www.gouletpens.com/products/rhodia-no-12-notepad-black-dot-grid">Rhodia No. 12</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In my random ink sample set I received the eight inks on the left, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.gouletpens.com/products/diamine-terracotta-40ml-bottled-ink">Diamine Terracotta</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.gouletpens.com/products/sailor-ink-studio-143-20ml-bottled-ink">Sailor Ink Studio 143</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.gouletpens.com/products/diamine-onyx-black-30ml-bottled-ink">Diamine Onyx Black</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The other inks pictured on the right were from a sample set I picked up from Goulet a while back.</p>
<p>I still haven&rsquo;t gone in on a full-size bottle of ink. Back in college I had a Pilot Iroshizuku bottle, but I don&rsquo;t remember what I did with it. I think I gave it to a friend. Now I&rsquo;m having fun trying out samples! My journal is eclectic with different colors and shades all over the place, but I like that. It will be fun to look back and see what I was experimenting with at different times.</p>
<p>Maybe someday I&rsquo;ll settle on a nice journal/pen/ink combo I can rock forever, but I&rsquo;m okay if that never happens. Experimentation is where the fun is at!</p>

<p><em>The following was transcribed from the pictured journal entry. I used Google Lens and a LOT of editing.</em></p>
<p>It has been easy to <strong>not</strong> make time to write recently. &ldquo;Busyness&rdquo; is the main culprit, but I&rsquo;ve also been spending time with its less boisterous sibling, distraction. And so here I find myself, back at the roots of my writing practice. The journal. I&rsquo;ve missed the empty page. The empty screen is nice too, in my writing software of choice, but I can&rsquo;t help feeling the weight of the myriad windows/apps/messages vying for my attention. So I&rsquo;ve returned to my empty page. It welcomes my attention and thought, but does not compete for them. It is an escape in plain sight.</p>
<p>The past couple weeks have been especially tricky with a sick daughter who doesn&rsquo;t want to sleep, a busy and understaffed season at work, and all sorts of house projects begging to be completed. All these things are important to give my time to, but I miss having time alone to work through my thoughts. And there is something unique to working through thoughts with pen and paper. It would be interesting to see how a particular thought path might develop differently if done digitally instead of analog. Digital thoughts can be discarded and reshaped much more easily. Analog thoughts are methodical and more planned out. Each word, each sentence, gets much more thought. There is no turning back.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so fun to see where thoughts lead me. I thought this would be an entry about busyness and distraction, but my mind seems more stuck on the difference between digital and analog mediums for thought exploration. Having a medium to capture your thoughts is useful, but how does the medium shape your thoughts? Is it better to be able to edit and rearrange your thoughts easily, or is it better, to follow a slow, linear progression? Or is it just different? If I had written this digitally, I might have edited the first paragraph to have a smoother segue, but I would have lost the original idea that led me to where I am now. Analog forces a full historical record. It takes a longer time to adjust course or backtrack, but you won&rsquo;t lose where you started. How many beautiful, half-baked thoughts have been lost in the editing phase of digital writing? Yet on the other side of the coin, dead branches should be pruned so that the healthy ones can grow stronger.</p>
<p>It would be nice to have the benefits of both analog and digital. I need someone to build a small microwave-style device that scans a notebook in its entirety, and then some sort of local, air-gapped Al separates and tags the content appropriately, moving it to my note app of choice. A dreamer has to dream. The major downfall of analog is how hard it is to re-surface at a later time. There are indexing and categorization systems that help with this, but they don&rsquo;t come close to what I can do digitally.</p>
<p>The experience of writing something new is so nice in analog though. Flip to an empty page, grab your writing utensil, and get going. I get the physical feedback of the pen, the sound of each stroke on the page, and my writing style is distinctly &ldquo;mine&rdquo;. I contrast that with my phone, where I feel obligated to read each notification before I get started writing. That is, if I even make it there without getting lost chasing a squirrel. It&rsquo;s not as good with a laptop either. I have to pull it out, boot it up, find my app, and make my way to a blank space for writing. It&rsquo;s not too much longer, but it feels so much further away than pen and paper.</p>
<p>This sounds a bit like digital-bashing, but I prefer it in many cases. I&rsquo;ve just been spending too much time there recently, and not enough time with my pen and paper. Here&rsquo;s to more time with my ad-free journal.</p>

			 <p>Compound and leverage are powerful forces to move us toward our desired outcomes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking about these two forces and how they can be used not only to improve finances, but they also apply to other areas of life.</p>
<p>When given consistent effort, some things will compound over time, like interest on money or the growth of a network. If we can identify these things, then we can give them small amounts of consistent effort to see amazing growth over the long term.</p>
<p>On the other hand, leverage can be used to amplify your efforts for outsized returns. In finances, leverage usually means taking on debt to acquire assets. When done right, the assets bring in more dollars than the debt takes out.</p>
<p>Compound plays the long game and trusts that what you put in will build upon itself.</p>
<p>Leverage amplifies your efforts to turn little resources into big value.</p>
<p>Consider the following ways you can put these forces to work for you:</p>
<h2 id="compound">Compound</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Business</strong>- Identify and complete 1 to 3 top tasks each day. You&rsquo;ll be amazed at what you&rsquo;ve done in a year.</li>
<li><strong>Relationships</strong> - Take some time each day to reach out to friends or family. Consistent bits of time devoted to your relationships go a long way.</li>
<li><strong>Network</strong> - Talk to new people and grow your network a little each week. The more it grows the easier it grows.</li>
<li><strong>Money</strong> - Put some of each paycheck toward compound investments. At least put it into a high-yield savings account!</li>
<li><strong>Health</strong> - Brush your teeth twice a day. Floss. Get enough sleep. Eat balanced, normal-sized portions. Exercise a couple times a week. You&rsquo;ll be superhuman in a year.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="leverage">Leverage</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Business</strong> - Spend the time to automate routine tasks. Use templates. Create process automations. Delegate when appropriate.</li>
<li><strong>Relationships</strong> - Leverage other assets for growth in your relationships. Spend lavishly on a loved one to get them a meaningful gift. Use your time to write a heartfelt letter to a friend. Share your skills to help your family.</li>
<li><strong>Network</strong> - Use your network to bring others into your network. Leverage events like conferences to find like-minded people who are also interested in finding you!</li>
<li><strong>Money</strong> - Take on a loan to buy an asset that pays for the loan and then some. The loan lets you buy an asset larger than you could afford on your own, increasing your net worth as debt is paid off. Leveraging money is risky, so be smart and don&rsquo;t over-leverage. Have some reserves to get you out of a pickle if needed.</li>
<li><strong>Health</strong> - Use your doctor! Leverage their years of medical knowledge to better understand your specific health situation.</li>
</ul>
<p>What other ways are you using compound and leverage? I&rsquo;m very curious to know!</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m worried about my blog undergoing a LinkedInification. A lot of my recent posts have been good candidates to cross post on LinkedIn, but when I&rsquo;m cross posting there I feel the tug to tweak my style for better &ldquo;engagement&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want that to drive what I write or how I write, so I&rsquo;m keeping an eye on it. I kinda like the idea of writing a full post on the blog, and then throwing a shorter summary version on LinkedIn, but that sounds like too much work.

			 <p>Yesterday was NASA&rsquo;s very first Agile Technical Interchange Meeting! NASA is becoming agile 🚀🏃‍♂️💨</p>
<p>I learned how Agile is applied outside of my discipline, web software, to improve how we build hardware and integrated systems, particularly in the systems engineering discipline.</p>
<p>Here are some ✨highlights✨ of NASA&rsquo;s agile journey:</p>
<p>💙 Agile = respect. Tears were shed during a cybersecurity team&rsquo;s transition to SAFe (Scaled Agile Framework). Years of pent-up frustration and pain came out as the team realized how unseen they felt due to working in a very reactive manner, with requests coming in all over the place and no visibility into what they were accomplishing. Now their capacity is clearly understood by their customers and their leadership, and they are delivering more and happier than ever before.</p>
<p>✈ Architecture affects agility. A team rearchitected their software to leverage microservices for coordinating drone traffic in lower-atmosphere urban air space. The architecture change has allowed them to be much more agile in how they deploy software.</p>
<p>🌐 NASA does open-source!? I heard from the OpenMDAO team about how they are building open-source software from NASA, and how adapting an agile mindset has allowed them to respond and work with the open-source community.</p>
<p>🔬 An agile mindset helps deliver valuable research. Much research happens at NASA, and adopting an agile mindset/approach is helping researchers think about how they deliver value with their research. This approach is not taught in doctorate programs, so it was fascinating to see the melding of these concepts and how important it is that NASA is thoughtful about what value our research products can deliver!</p>
<p>We have a ways to go, but we&rsquo;re on our way! I&rsquo;m looking forward to staying connected with this community and seeing what else can be done with an agile mindset at NASA - National Aeronautics and Space Administration!</p>

<h3 id="dad-stuff">Dad Stuff</h3>
<p>My daughter is 10 months old! Time is flying. It seems like she has learned something new every couple of days. As I write, the newest developments are that her top front teeth are coming in, she&rsquo;s loving waving and clapping, we&rsquo;re trying out cloth diapers, and when we ask her to say &ldquo;dada&rdquo; or &ldquo;mama&rdquo; she consistently replies &ldquo;dada&rdquo; to either.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m soaking up every moment with her, particularly laying on the floor and letting her crawl over and attack me while we giggle together. I got teary-eyed the other day as I held her while she slept and I thought about how someday I won&rsquo;t be able to hold her anymore and these days will feel like a distant, warm memory. All the more reason to really be present, put the phone down, and take in each moment as completely as I can.</p>
<h3 id="creating">Creating</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been feeling extra creative lately! I&rsquo;ve been writing on the blog, I set up a digital garden at <a href="https://garden.weidok.al">garden.weidok.al</a>, which I am mostly using to share my sermon notes and Readwise notes, and I created an app called <a href="https://weidok.al/2024/05/03/introducing-fed-meetup.html">Fed Meetup</a>! I would have thought that becoming a dad meant I would have way less time, but somehow it has opened me up to being more creative. Funny how things work out not at all how I expect!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also been considering starting up a newsletter. I like the idea of having a commitment to write weekly within a single topic, and writing about something that is useful to others. The newsletter would be for average computer users/office workers, and would be about tips to use a computer just a little bit better. Things like hotkeys, workflows, apps, lesser-known parts of the OS, or anything that could help people be just a touch more efficient on a computer. If that sounds like something you would read and subscribe to, <a href="mailto:jake@weidok.al">let me know</a>!</p>
<h3 id="work">Work</h3>
<p>We launched the NASA Cause Analysis Tool! I&rsquo;ve been the product manager for this app since it was approved to be funded back in April of last year, and it&rsquo;s hard for me to believe that we already have working production software! Now that it&rsquo;s released, we&rsquo;re focused on releasing it, again and again. There&rsquo;s a lot more functionality yet to be added, but I&rsquo;m excited to have it available to users so we can get feedback as we build new increments. I&rsquo;d like to write a post sharing more about this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s performance review time of the year at NASA, so I just finished up my self-assessment and feedback for coworkers. I&rsquo;m learning to love this time of year, as it forces me to reflect on the past year, which is something I would like myself to do anyways. I&rsquo;m thinking about writing a blog post about my highlights from this year at NASA.</p>
<p>There are so many exciting things going on right now, some of them I briefly mentioned in <a href="https://weidok.al/2024/04/30/a-day-in.html">my post about my day earlier this week</a>. While it&rsquo;s busy, I feel fortunate to be in this place at this time. I would have never thought I&rsquo;d be doing all these cool things and working on projects that reach across the whole agency.</p>
<h3 id="faith-and-friends">Faith and Friends</h3>
<p>So many babies are being born! I&rsquo;m not sure how many since my last update, but I think we&rsquo;ve added around 5 new babies among our church group since then. It has been fun sharing the joy with everyone and helping out by participating in meal trains.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been really enjoying taking sermon notes in Obsidian, and then <a href="https://garden.weidok.al/notes/110-sermons/">publishing them to my digital garden</a> to share with my friends since we usually talk about the sermon from the past week when we get together on Thursday evenings. I&rsquo;d like to write a post about how I&rsquo;m using Obsidian on my phone to take sermon notes. With markdown formatting, Obsidian is so much easier to to format on-the-fly than other note-taking apps I&rsquo;ve tried in the past. And I like digital better than analog for sermon notes because it&rsquo;s searchable, I can easily copy/paste snippets of scripture, and I can take pictures during the sermon if needed and add them into the notes.</p>
<h3 id="lawn-care">Lawn Care</h3>
<p>That time of year has rolled around again&hellip; I&rsquo;m focused on lawn care. I have a lot to learn here! When our house was built two years ago, they didn&rsquo;t do a great job rockhounding the soil, so it&rsquo;s tough and rocky and the grass comes up in patches. I tried re-seeding last year which helped a little, but not too much. I think I need to aerate.</p>
<p>Anyways, most of our grass is sickly but we had a couple of patches that grew up really fast and thick. They grew way quicker than I expected, so by the time I cut them they were too tall and I killed them so now we have some yellow patches in the back.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re planning to redo our flower beds soon. Those were installed for us but with no weed barrier or defined edge, so that has gotten out of control. I&rsquo;m going to re-edge it and put in some landscaping rock instead of mulch because I do not want to deal with mulch every year.</p>
<h3 id="leisure">Leisure</h3>
<p>In between everything above, I&rsquo;m trying to make time for <a href="https://weidok.al/2024/04/28/beautiful-day-out.html">disc golf with friends</a> every now and then so they don&rsquo;t pass me up :) I&rsquo;ve also been enjoying reading <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29581.Foundation_and_Empire?from_search=true&amp;from_srp=true&amp;qid=Ko73QCm0g0&amp;rank=1">&ldquo;Foundation and Empire&rdquo; by Isaac Asimov</a>.</p>
<h3 id="exercise">Exercise</h3>
<p>Yeah&hellip;. Not been doing great here. With all my creative passion recently, I&rsquo;ve thrown exercise to the side. I&rsquo;m looking to change that though. The doc says I have elevated cholesterol and triglycerides, so it&rsquo;s time to take exercise seriously and back off the carbs. I&rsquo;m sad about taking time away from all the things above that I love, but there&rsquo;s plenty of &ldquo;gray&rdquo; time in my day where I&rsquo;m just distracted that I could take from instead. And I know from the past that getting into a good exercise routine will just bring me more energy and vigor, so it will be additive rather than subtractive. My wife and I tried some YouTube yoga together yesterday, but then as we were about to enter child&rsquo;s pose she noticed a small spider in front of her face and that abruptly ended our session!</p>

Federal employees are flying cross-country to get together and meet on various topics to do their work more effectively. I see this, especially at my organization, NASA. Just this winter I flew out to Kennedy Space Center for the Office of Safety and Mission Assurance Face-to-Face with more than 50 other colleagues to talk about where the organization is going and to do workshops together. We do these twice a year.</p>
<p>Multiply 2x per year times the number of employees traveling, and then multiply that by all the other sub-organizations at NASA doing similar events and that adds up to a LOT of annual travel costs. But NASA is just one piece of the federal puzzle and a rather small piece at that. In 2023 NASA&rsquo;s $28.3 billion budget only accounted for 0.3% of the federal budget as shown in this graphic from <a href="https://www.usaspending.gov/explorer/agency">usaspending.gov</a>.</p>

<h2 id="the-challenge-of-planning-group-travel">The Challenge of Planning Group Travel</h2>
<p>Planning travel for large organizations is hard. When you combine the number of different origins travelers will be coming from with the different destinations they could travel to, it becomes difficult to understand the combinations. How do you compare the costs of your destinations? Right now, this is done by gut feel.</p>
<p>Closer destinations or ones that already have people living there are probably cheaper, right? Well, usually, yes, in simple situations. But not always, and this can get complex when you have different amounts of travelers living in various potential destinations. Or what if you have people all across the country? How do you triangulate and weigh the &ldquo;closest&rdquo; city between all travelers? Not to mention some farther cities have cheaper airfare costs than closer cities. AND to even further complicate it, you need to consider each city&rsquo;s cost of living, which contributes to Meals &amp; Incidentals Expenses.</p>
<p>Do you have a headache too?</p>
<h2 id="introducing-fed-meetup">Introducing Fed Meetup</h2>
<p>I created <a href="https://fedmeetup.com">Fed Meetup</a> to help federal travel planners optimize their destinations for large in-person meetings. It uses publicly available city pair and per diem rate data to compare travel costs for in-person events across multiple destinations.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h3 id="how-does-it-work">How Does It Work?</h3>
<p>First, enter how many <strong>days</strong> long the event will be and the <strong>month</strong> of travel. This is used to calculate per diem rates, which fluctuate in some locations based on the month.</p>
<p>Next, input the various <strong>origins</strong> each traveler will be coming from, along with the number of travelers coming from the origin. Right now, you can specify an origin as either a NASA Center or an Airport. In the future, I plan to provide other predefined origins for agencies other than NASA. If you work at an agency and want your locations added to their own list, reach out to me and I&rsquo;d be happy to work with you.</p>
<p>Once you have entered your origins, it&rsquo;s time to select the <strong>destinations</strong> you would like to compare. There are two options for adding destinations:</p>
<ol>
<li>Add bulk destinations from a preset (currently the only option is All NASA Centers. I plan to add locations for other agencies in the future)</li>
<li>Add individual destinations by airport or NASA Center.</li>
</ol>
<p>After you&rsquo;ve followed the steps above, you&rsquo;re ready to <strong>submit</strong> and let Fed Meetup work its magic! Fed Meetup will run its calculations and provide you with a ranked list of destinations from cheapest to most expensive. If a direct flight can not be found for an origin-destination pair, that destination is ranked lower in the results and marked with an asterisk to indicate the total cost does not include airfare for that origin-destination pair. For each result, you can see the total cost, airfare cost, and per diem cost.</p>
<h3 id="why-build-this">Why Build This?</h3>
<p>Fed Meetup was born out of a <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/stmd/stmd-prizes-challenges-crowdsourcing-program/center-of-excellence-for-collaborative-innovation-coeci/nasa-spark/">NASA Spark</a> campaign. The campaign was looking for existing tools that could be used to evaluate the best meeting locations for large meetings, specifically using federal city-pair and per diem rates. No such tool existed, so I decided to build my own. I was looking for a fun side project that was useful, so this was a great fit! All-in it took me about 15 hours to build this app. I&rsquo;m proud that I was able to get it completed within the two-week timeframe I had before the Spark campaign closed, but there is a lot that I would like to improve.</p>
<h3 id="future-plans">Future Plans</h3>
<p>Remember how NASA was only 0.3% of the federal budget? My grand vision for Fed Meetup is to get it into the hands of as many federal agencies as I can. It&rsquo;s free and open to anyone to use, so my hope is that agencies will find it useful and adopt it to make their travel spending more efficient. All Americans benefit when taxpayer dollars are used more prudently.</p>
<p>To make that grand vision possible, there are lots of little improvements I&rsquo;d like to make. This is more of a grocery list than a roadmap, but you have to start somewhere, right?</p>
<ul>
<li>🎨 Improve the design. Right now it is very wordy. Experience is not as good on mobile. Simplify the interface and make it more intuitive.</li>
<li>🏙 Allow users to select cities as origins and destinations.</li>
<li>✈Related to the above, for cities that have multiple airports (Washington D.C.) the tool would select the cheapest airport pair for that city.</li>
<li>🧮 Update the results to show more info about how the calculation was made. This would allow users to fact-check the results and trust them more.</li>
<li>❗ Improve form validation when there are input errors, so it is clear what needs to be changed.</li>
<li>ℹ Add an &ldquo;About&rdquo; page that describes the tool and why it exists - link to this post???</li>
<li>🏛 Add preset origins/destinations for other agencies (e.g., &ldquo;All Department of Energy Locations&rdquo;). 💡 If you are from another agency, please reach out and help me get the locations set up for your agency!</li>
<li>🍃 Consider carbon footprint in the calculation and results. I would need a data source for these calculations. I have not looked into this yet.</li>
<li>🚗 If traveling between close cities, calculate Privately Owned Vehicle mileage and compare it with airfare prices.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="now-what">Now What?</h2>
<p>Time to spread the word! I&rsquo;ll be out evangelizing Fed Meetup to those who need to know about it. If you work in a federal agency, send it to the person in your area who organizes travel. Have them try it out.</p>
<p>If you use Fed Meetup, send me some feedback. My email inbox and LinkedIn DMs are open!</p>
<p>Safe travels!</p>

			 <p>On days like today,  I marvel as I reflect all the awesome things I get to do in my role here at the NASA Safety Center.</p>
<p>Today I&hellip;</p>
<p>🐛 Hosted a &ldquo;bug hunt&rdquo; for the new app we launched last month, having the whole development team try to break the app to catch bugs before they become an issue.</p>
<p>🌒 Spoke with someone from the Human Landing System program about their interest in using a fishbone (Ishikawa) diagram to identify what could cause the lunar lander to tip over during landing. This is a problem that has plagued recent commercial lunar landings, and we are looking to support these use cases in our new app.</p>
<p>🥗 Ate a fantastic salad with my team at the café in the new Research Support Building at NASA Glenn Research Center</p>
<p>🤹‍♀️ Consulted with a co-worker about how we could use Microsoft Delve to surface Reliability Engineers in the agency with unique skills that could be shared with others in that discipline.</p>
<p>📊 Reviewed the Science Mission Directorate&rsquo;s system for tracking risks to inform how our team will build an agency-level tool that surfaces elevated risks from the mission directorates.</p>
<p>👬 Demoed our API for mishap data to a group building a Digital Twin of NASA facilities. Mishap data could be layered with information we have on aging infrastructure to build a compelling case for which areas of NASA&rsquo;s infrastructure are in the most need of attention.</p>
<p>And that all is just the tip of the iceberg! Looking forward to tomorrow!</p>

			 <p><strong>Me</strong>: &ldquo;Oh, I need to respond to that later.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Text Message</strong>: <em>cries softly as it floats into the void, never to be seen again</em></p>
<h2 id="text-message-chaos-and-overwhelm">Text Message Chaos and Overwhelm</h2>
<p>Until recently, I&rsquo;ve managed my text messages differently from email or work-related instant messaging.</p>
<p>I never did anything with text messages other than collect hundreds upon hundreds of conversations that sat in a chronological heap waiting to welcome me each time I opened my messaging app.  Conversations that needed a response would get intermixed with ones that did not need a response and would get buried as more messages were received in yet other conversations. I don&rsquo;t receive a <em>ton</em> of text messages, but with no system at all to handle them, I felt overwhelmed when opening my messaging app and was ghosting a lot of people as a result.</p>
<p>This led to some cognitive dissonance where I felt like a wizard in the world of email, but I felt like a Neanderthal when it came to responding to friends and family over text.</p>
<h2 id="my-text-message-triage-system">My Text Message Triage System</h2>
<p>Now my process for handling texts is similar to my process for emails. Conceptually, I think of my messaging app like my email inbox, with each conversation being like an extremely long-running email thread.</p>
<p>For each message I receive, I work through the following questions:</p>
<h3 id="1-can-this-conversation-be-deleted">1. Can This Conversation Be Deleted?</h3>
<p>Bye-bye spam. I don&rsquo;t delete many conversations because they don&rsquo;t take up much storage anyway, but if it&rsquo;s something I know I will never revisit then I burn it with fire and move on with my day.</p>
<h3 id="2-is-this-message-just-for-reference">2. Is This Message Just for Reference?</h3>
<p>Archive it! If I don&rsquo;t need to respond, then conversations go straight to my archive where they can still be searched and retrieved.</p>
<h3 id="3-can-i-respond-in-2-minutes">3. Can I Respond In 2 Minutes?</h3>
<p>Just do it! Future-me has better things to do and doesn&rsquo;t need the cognitive overhead of thinking about needing to respond. Knock this out now.</p>
<p>After I&rsquo;ve responded, I archive the conversation to get it out of my inbox. The only exception is if I am awaiting a quick response and I will want to follow up if I don&rsquo;t receive one. Then it stays in the inbox.</p>
<h3 id="4-do-i-need-to-respond-but-cant-right-now">4. Do I Need to Respond, But Can&rsquo;t Right Now?</h3>
<p>This one is a more context dependent.</p>
<p>If I can&rsquo;t respond because <em>I just don&rsquo;t have time</em>, then the message stays in the inbox. Unread or read, doesn&rsquo;t matter. If it&rsquo;s in the inbox, I need to get to it.</p>
<p>If <em>I need to do something before I can respond</em>, then that gets transferred to my to-do list, and I leave the message in the inbox.</p>
<h2 id="other-notes-on-my-system">Other Notes on My System</h2>
<h3 id="some-group-chats-stay-in-the-inbox">Some Group Chats Stay in The Inbox</h3>
<p>I would love to get to complete inbox-zero and archive EVERYTHING, but with Google Messages if I archive a group chat, it is clunky to start a new message to the chat. So, I leave three of my high-volume group chats in my inbox at all times.</p>
<h3 id="use-swipe-actions">Use Swipe Actions</h3>
<p>Swipe right to delete a conversation, swipe left to archive it. This helps me move through messages quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They see they can and must stand up, because they begin to understand how genuinely monstrous they will become, otherwise, feeding on their resentment, transforming it into the most destructive of wishes. To say it again: There is very little difference between the capacity for mayhem and destruction, integrated, and strength of character. This is one of the most difficult lessons of life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>- <a href="https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/">Jordan B. Peterson</a>, <a href="https://a.co/d/5q4bKF2">12 Rules for Life</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To be good, you must be dangerous.</p>
<p>Much of my life, I equated dangerous with bad. But I have come to realize that a chief aim of the good ought to be to increase their dangerousness. This is necessary when operating in and around evil.</p>
<p>A capacity for evil is not inherently bad. Your capacity is morally neutral, but it is up to you to wield it appropriately. C.S. Lewis illustrates this well when answering the question of why there is evil at all:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;‘Why did God make a creature of such rotten stuff that it went wrong?’ The better stuff a creature is made of—the cleverer and stronger and freer it is—then the better it will be if it goes right, but also the worse it will be if it goes wrong. A cow cannot be very good or very bad; a dog can be both better and worse; a child better and worse still; an ordinary man, still more so; a man of genius, still more so; a superhuman spirit best—or worst—of all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>- <a href="https://www.cslewis.com/us/">C.S. Lewis</a>, <a href="https://a.co/d/eLUvhU1">Mere Christianity</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jesus makes this point too, when telling his disciples that they ought to be wise as serpents. This is potent imagery considering it was a serpent that caused the fall of man.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Behold, I am sending you out as sheep in the midst of wolves, so be wise as serpents and innocent as doves.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2010%3A16&amp;version=ESV">Matthew 10:16 ESV</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>He implores them to wield the wisdom of the serpent with the innocence of the dove. Why not just tell them to be innocent as doves? Because to be good, you must be dangerous.</p>
<p>This then, is the aim of the good: to be cleverer and stronger and freer. To be dangerous.</p>

GIVEN setup  
WHEN action  
THEN result  
</code></pre><p>I write a lot of user stories for my team, and they need to be clear, to the point, and verifiable. This template was born out of a need for consistency in how user stories were defined and written and aims to give a development team the bare minimum they need to deliver a hot, fresh slice of valuable software. Nothing here is ground-breaking, but it serves as a foundation for defining work when building software.</p>
<h1 id="user-story-statement-section">User Story Statement Section</h1>
<p>First, we start with the traditional user story statement.</p>
<p>As a<br>
I want<br>
So that</p>
<p>This forces the author of the story to be clear about who wants what, and most importantly, <em>why</em> they want it.</p>
<p>For the <code>As a</code> clause, try to be clear about a specific type of person. If your description can conjure up a mental picture of a distinct archetypal user-type, you&rsquo;re doing it right. Avoid writing simply <code>As a user</code> at all costs. We&rsquo;ve all done it, and we should all be ashamed.</p>
<p>In your <code>I want</code> section, describe <strong>one</strong> want. If you are tempted to have more than one clause here, you might consider if an additional user story is warranted.</p>
<p>With the <code>So that</code> clause, focus intently on the unique value this will provide to your archetypal user-type. This is the hardest clause to write, but also the most important to do well. It&rsquo;s value may be obscure to some, because it does not directly contribute to the &ldquo;spec&rdquo; of what needs built. But this is your chance to clearly define the impact of this work to be done. It breathes life into the code to be written, and gives your designer, developer, tester, etc. a clear reason for doing what they&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<h1 id="description-section">Description Section</h1>
<p>This is your chance to go into more detail about your user story. What should the user-facing phrasing be? What data are we working with?</p>
<p>I often will take a first pass at this providing as much important context and detail as I can from the product perspective. Sometimes, a developer will go into description after I&rsquo;ve written it and add a subsection for <code>Technical Details</code> to go more in depth on any technical nuances to the user story that should be considered during development and testing.</p>
<h1 id="acceptance-criteria-section">Acceptance Criteria Section</h1>
<p>Acceptance criteria gives the team a clear basis to know when they are done with a user story. It is something we can point to and either say &ldquo;Yes, we accomplished what we wanted to&rdquo; or &ldquo;No, this doesn&rsquo;t do everything we needed&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I write acceptance criteria one of two ways, and sometimes I use both.</p>
<h2 id="bullet-syntax">Bullet Syntax</h2>
<p>Acceptance criteria can be a simple bullet-list. This is more often the case for smaller user stories, or ones that are more technical. This can be a simple, useful tool to include any non-functional requirements that need to be met to accept the user story.</p>
<h2 id="gherkin-syntax">Gherkin Syntax</h2>
<p>When it makes sense, I write acceptance criteria in GIVEN, WHEN, THEN format. This lays out a very clear path for manually testing the user story, and this syntax can be used for behavior driven development. It becomes an executable spec that we can use directly in our automated tests.</p>
<h1 id="example">Example</h1>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an example of a user story I&rsquo;ve written recently:</p>
<blockquote>
<h1 id="user-story">User Story</h1>
<p><strong>As a</strong> case owner or admin<br>
<strong>I want</strong> to add users to my case<br>
<strong>So that</strong> I can collaborate with others<br>
<strong>And</strong> determine appropriate access levels for CRUD operations</p>
<h1 id="description">Description</h1>
<p>link to mockups</p>
<p>The scope of this ticket includes setting up roles in the application. See the roles matrix for the case-specific roles in the application.</p>
<p>Add a button in the top right to add case members (see mockups, only visible for case owners and admins).</p>
<p>Owners and admins can add other members. The owner can add Admins, but Admins cannot add other Admins.</p>
<p>After clicking the button, the user selects a person and a role, and then can save them as a member to the case. After saving, the new member should be displayed in the case members table.</p>
<p>The role options will be&hellip;</p>
<ul>
<li>Case Roles
<ul>
<li><strong>Admin</strong> (CRUD, only visible to case owner)</li>
<li><strong>Contributor</strong> (CRU, D data they created. Can remove items from diagram)</li>
<li><strong>Report Editor</strong> (R, U report section)</li>
<li><strong>View Only</strong> (R)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that &ldquo;Owner&rdquo; is not one of the role options, because the owner is whoever created the case and there will only ever be one owner per case.</p>
<h1 id="acceptance-criteria">Acceptance Criteria</h1>
<p><strong>GIVEN</strong> I am a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(owner, case admin)<br>
<strong>WHEN</strong> I add a member as a contributor<br>
<strong>THEN</strong> the member is displayed in the case members table with the contributor role</p>
<p><strong>GIVEN</strong> I am a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(contributor, report editor, view only)<br>
<strong>THEN</strong> I do not see the button to add a member</p>
<p><strong>GIVEN</strong> I am &ldquo;case admin&rdquo;<br>
<strong>WHEN</strong> I am selecting the role for a new member<br>
<strong>THEN</strong> I can not select &ldquo;case admin&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While this template helps define the user story, it is important to remember that the user story is a placeholder for conversation. If you write this up and then immediately push it to your team to work on it, you&rsquo;re missing the beauty of the user story. Bring your draft of the user story before the team and then have a conversation about it. Invite ideas and questions from others on the team. Define and come to a common understanding of the problem to be solved, or the value to be delivered. Then determine how you will bring forth that solution or value.</p>

			 <p>I added a <a href="/blogroll">blogroll</a> to my site! I had been thinking about creating this for a while, and the new <a href="https://help.micro.blog/t/recommendations/2671">recommendations</a> feature in Micro.blog gave me the push to finally do it. I added it to my navigation links, but&hellip; it&rsquo;s getting really crowded up there. I may have to do something about that, but I want people to be able to find my blogroll, and putting a link in any of my other pages didn&rsquo;t seem quite right.</p>
<p>For now, it is just a list of sites, but I&rsquo;d like to add little one-liner descriptions of why I like each site. I&rsquo;ve had a lot of fun discovering blogs through the blogrolls of others, and I&rsquo;m excited to start to share my own recommendations! My list will grow as I discover new blogs. Right now I&rsquo;ve been finding a lot of interesting blogs by clicking around at <a href="https://blogroll.org/">https://blogroll.org/</a> and <a href="https://ooh.directory/">https://ooh.directory/</a>. These are awesome resources to find independent folks sharing from their own space on the web.</p>
<p>My favorite way to discover sites though is through personal recommendations. The more organic, the better. Here&rsquo;s my rank order of favorite ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>A personal 1:1 recommendation - &ldquo;Jake! You gotta check out&hellip;.&rdquo;</li>
<li>A link in a post I&rsquo;m enjoying (falling down a rabbit hole)</li>
<li>A blogroll on a personal site</li>
<li>A blog listing site (like those linked above)</li>
</ol>
<p>If you have some blogs I need to check out or other ways of discovering blogs, I&rsquo;d love to hear about them!</p>

I have an idea for an interactive haiku but I&rsquo;m not positive how that will work since my posts are published in Markdown. It should be a fun mini-project!</p>
<p>To my chagrin, I tend towards rule-following, so most of my haiku will follow the 5-7-5 format. I would like to experiment outside of those lines from time to time.</p>

<p>whatever you do<br>

pure, strong, undeserved</p>
<p>oh you fool! live more!<br>

so far to be same old me<br>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p><a href="https://weidok.al">My website</a> looked quite different at its beginning. I thought starting a blog would be a good opportunity to play around with new technology, so I decided to teach myself <a href="https://kit.svelte.dev/">SvelteKit</a> and build my site with it. It was very exciting: I would build in SvelteKit, write all my posts as standalone markdown files, and deploy on <a href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a>. As I started building and exploring what other people had done to get inspiration, I came across a concept called the <a href="https://indieweb.org/">IndieWeb</a>. I felt aligned with the values of this web community, so I wanted to build my site to be part of it. Suddenly, my to-do list was expanding rapidly to include all sorts of IndieWeb specs and principles. Would markdown files be enough to do everything I wanted to do? Perhaps I would need to set up a database using something like <a href="https://supabase.com/">Supabase</a>&hellip;</p>
<p>The more I added to my to-do list for the site, the more I began to dread working on it. This was supposed to be fun, what happened?</p>
<p>I lost my Why. What I <em>really</em> wanted was to start writing. To have a place to share myself and to figure out how to do that. That was my Why. But I wasn&rsquo;t clear on that. I thought this site would be a good place to write <em>and</em> be a fun coding project. Mixing those was a mistake for me. I became so consumed with perfecting the design and functionality that I had no time to think about writing.</p>
<p>So what to do? I had this thing that I built, that I actually quite liked, but it was taking me further from my Why rather than toward it.</p>
<p>I decided to tear it all down.</p>
<p>I threw everything away and started from a blank slate. How could I just write? How could I stay connected to my Why? A blogging platform, duh! Other people have already solved the problem of creating a website whose primary purpose is publishing writing. In fact, <a href="https://www.manton.org/">Manton</a> over at <a href="https://micro.blog/">Micro.blog</a> solved that problem <em>and</em> built his solution on the IndieWeb principles I admire, so that was the clear choice for me. I took everything I had written and migrated it over to Micro.blog, abandoning my SvelteKit project.</p>
<p>After the migration, everything felt better. I had space to write, space to bring forth my Why. I still couldn&rsquo;t keep myself from customizing themes and plugins to make the site my own, but a little bit of play is okay as long as it leaves my Why undisturbed.</p>
<p>Why had this not been obvious in the beginning? Well for one, I didn&rsquo;t even know about Micro.blog or the IndieWeb when I started out. But more importantly, my thinking had been clouded by an unclear Why and a fear of judgment, which I&rsquo;ve come to realize are connected. My fear was something like, &ldquo;This is supposed to be a web software guy and he didn&rsquo;t build his own site from scratch? He must not <strong>really</strong> know his stuff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a silly fear. Who cares? Have you seen all the intelligent people working in the web space that host their sites on a platform? They&rsquo;re everywhere! And yet, I could not come to that realization until I was really clear on my Why.</p>
<p>I share all of this to implore you to evaluate your Why. Do you have the right Why? Are you clear on it? Is what you&rsquo;re doing moving you in the right direction? If not, it&rsquo;s very possible that you can make minor course corrections to get you back on track. You should try that first. But if you&rsquo;ve gotten far away from your Why, don&rsquo;t be afraid to tear it all down. It&rsquo;s okay to start at zero. The sunk cost has already sunk, so don&rsquo;t drown yourself trying to save it.</p>
<p>Tearing it all down is not the fastest way to do a thing, but it may be the way to do <em>the right</em> thing.</p>
<hr>
<p>Here are some screenshots of what the site looked like before. I had a v1 for my homepage, which was ripped off from this YouTube video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylCUH6LkW80&amp;ab_channel=Smoljames">Build &amp; Deploy a Modern Web Portfolio w. SvelteKit &amp; TailwindCSS (youtube.com)</a>. That felt fake and not like my own, so I started to simplify it into a v2 before deciding to tear it all down.</p>

<p>I appreciate this reframing of a blog post as a &ldquo;piece of my self&rdquo;. As I set out in the early stages of my blog, this captures quite well what I aspire for it to be. Each post is one tiny piece of me, a snapshot in time of one aspect of my self I thought worth sharing. Brought together as a whole, they tell a scattered story of my wanderings.</p>
<p>Some posts will be technical, some funny, some vulnerable, and some excited, because these are all pieces of my self. I look forward to looking back on years-old posts, and reminiscing where I was on my path at a given time. I already enjoy doing this with personal journal entries, but I have a sense that there will be a unique quality to reflecting on the progression of my blog.</p>
<p>I am also eager for serendipitous moments when someone encounters one of these pieces of my self, and is so compelled by it that they take time to discuss it with me. Positive or negative, if someone is engaging with one of these pieces of my self then it must have struck a chord, and I think that is a decent signal that I am approximating Truth, which is one of my ultimate aims of this blog. To be truth-seeking in my self and truth-seeking in my interests.</p>
<p>I already felt this a bit with my recent post on <a href="https://weidok.al/2024/02/15/i-use-my.html">My Obsidian Daily Note Template</a>. I was astounded by how quickly people were adopting parts of it or all of it. As I published it I thought, &ldquo;Is this too &lsquo;in the weeds&rsquo;? Did I waste my time going into all this detail?&rdquo;. But there were people out there, quite a few, looking for someone to guide them through these particular weeds. It is a wonderful feeling to create a point of connection. Something you and another can both behold and say, &ldquo;This resonates&rdquo;.</p>
<p>So this, too, is one piece among others. If it resonates, I would love to hear from you.</p>

<h1 id="overview">Overview</h1>
<p>My template allows me to have the same daily note created for me each day. Here&rsquo;s what it looks like:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I&rsquo;ll talk more about each individual section later in this post, but overall this daily note has helped me to become more organized and focused. Its primary purpose is managing tasks and rapidly logging notes throughout the day. Having one place to collect both tasks and quick notes has been helpful for me. A nice perk of doing it in Obsidian is that those quick notes can easily evolve into standalone markdown files if they need to, but the key is having a really <em>low friction</em> place to capture a thought or task.</p>
<p>Having my daily note link to other &ldquo;periodic&rdquo; notes (daily, weekly, monthly) feels very Obsidian-ish, but truth be told I don&rsquo;t use the links too often. They are nice when I need them though, like quickly needing to get to something I logged yesterday.</p>
<p>I used to use the 5 Minute Journal section more than I do now, but this has been replaced by analog journaling. I sort of miss having this stored digitally, and I&rsquo;m sure I could hack together some awesome digital journal dashboard with Dataview, but that&rsquo;s not really the point, is it? Journaling analog helps me to slow down and really reflect, which seems to make my individual sessions more meaningful. And that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m really looking for. All that being said, I do still like using the 5-Minute Journal occasionally when I&rsquo;m feeling scattered and need a quick dose of mindfulness while at my computer.</p>
<p>The Today&rsquo;s Notes section is another one I don&rsquo;t use too often, but it&rsquo;s fun to have. I&rsquo;m not using it to navigate between notes I&rsquo;m currently working on that day, because Obsidian has great navigation features I&rsquo;m using instead (e.g., tabs, search). But I do like having it whenever I take a look at past daily notes. It&rsquo;s fun to see a snapshot of what I worked on any given day, and the combination of the daily log, completed tasks, and Today&rsquo;s Notes paints a nice picture of what I was doing and thinking.</p>
<h1 id="plugins">Plugins</h1>
<h2 id="daily-notes-and-periodic-notes">Daily Notes and Periodic Notes</h2>
<p>These plugins both can create a daily note from a specified template file. Periodic Notes allows the creation of some additional types of notes, like weekly, monthly, quarterly, and yearly.</p>
<p>I prefer to keep my daily notes in their own folder, and each daily note&rsquo;s title is formatted as <code>YYYY-MM-DD</code>.</p>
<p>I keep my template file in &ldquo;Bins/Templates/Daily Note&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s my config for Daily Notes:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Here&rsquo;s my config for Periodic Notes (you&rsquo;ll see I also use weekly and monthly notes, which I link to from my daily note):</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2 id="templater">Templater</h2>
<p>With Templater, if I create a file from a template, either manually or through Daily Notes or Periodic Notes, I can run some code from my template <em>when the template is instantiated</em>. This allows me to get things like the current date, daily quote, date ranges for tasks, and file title at the time when I use the template.</p>
<p>You can even use Templater to run your own JavaScript during note creation, but I am not using that in the current iteration of my daily notes template.</p>
<p>Here is my current config for Templater:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The two important parts are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Specify a template folder (I use &ldquo;Bins/Templates&rdquo;)</li>
<li>Trigger Templater on new file creation. You want this on so that Templater works with Daily Notes and Periodic Notes.</li>
</ol>
<p>I use Templater all over my daily note template, and anything between <code>&lt;% ... %&gt;</code> is Templater syntax.</p>
<h2 id="dataview">Dataview</h2>
<p>Dataview is a powerful way to query data across all of your notes in your Obsidian vault. For my daily note, I use it to display any notes I created or modified that day.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe I did anything unique with the config for Dataview, much of the setup is for viewing preference.</p>
<h2 id="tasks">Tasks</h2>
<p>Obsidian is the main place I track tasks digitally, and I use the Tasks plugin to do that. My full setup with Tasks warrants a separate post, but for my daily note I use it to capture tasks in my Daily Log and to display tasks that are:</p>
<ul>
<li>overdue</li>
<li>due today</li>
<li>coming soon (next 3 days)</li>
<li>completed today</li>
</ul>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t changed much from the default Tasks config. I just have it configured to add a &ldquo;done date&rdquo; each time I complete a task.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2 id="quickadd">QuickAdd</h2>
<p>QuickAdd allows running macros from anywhere in Obsidian. I have a macro setup that can be run from anywhere and allows me to quickly write up text that gets appended at the top of my Daily Log with the current timestamp.</p>
<p>To configure this I created a macro called &ldquo;Capture to daily note&rdquo; in QuickAdd:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In the settings for that macro, I tell it where to add the text, and how to create the Daily Note if it has not already been created:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>To summarize, QuickAdd looks for today&rsquo;s daily note, and then inserts my supplied text after the header I supplied, which is <code>## Daily Log</code>, and gives it some special formatting that I specify near the bottom of the settings. More on this in the Daily Log Section.</p>
<h2 id="buttons">Buttons</h2>
<p>Buttons allows you to place buttons in your notes that can run macros. I use a button in my daily note templated to run the QuickAdd macro I described above. This allows me to really quickly capture a short note to my daily log, even if I am viewing my Daily Note on reading mode (which is something I end up doing often from mobile).</p>
<h2 id="calendar">Calendar</h2>
<p>I use the calendar plugin to navigate between my daily and weekly notes, and to create them.</p>
<h1 id="the-template">The Template</h1>
<p>You can get the full template from this <a href="https://gist.github.com/jakeweidokal/027072dc75ddc77ec9595739808db592">Gist on Github</a>. Below I&rsquo;ll break down the template by section so you can take only the pieces and parts you need.</p>
<h2 id="frontmatter-habits">Frontmatter Habits</h2>

<ul>
<li>Templater</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>For my habits section, I use the YAML frontmatter of the markdown file to track any daily habits. I use Templater to get the week number and save it as a property. I also use the Frontmatter to tag all daily notes with the <code>#daily</code> tag.  After that, all additional front matter fields are used to track daily metrics, which could be things like weight, times, mood, etc.</p>
<p>To be honest, I don&rsquo;t use this much anymore, but it was useful when I was doing intermittent fasting. I was eating within an 8 hour window each day, so I used this section to track when I started eating, when I stopped eating, and my weight. Then, with this data stored in each daily note, I used the Obsidian Charts plugin in my weekly and monthly notes to trend my progress over time. If you are interested in how this is setup, shoot me an email and let me know.</p>

<h3 id="description-2">Description</h3>
<p>All my daily notes have a file title in the format <code>YYYY-MM-DD</code>, but I like having a more readable format that includes the weekday.</p>
<p>I use the <code>tp.date.now</code> function to format the date from the title of the file. Here are what the 4 different parameters in the function do:</p>
<ol>
<li>Format - sets the format for the date</li>
<li>Offset - I keep this at 0 because I want the current date. 1 would give me tomorrow, -1 would give me yesterday.</li>
<li>Reference - the date to use. If not provided, the function uses today&rsquo;s date when a note is created from it. I supply the file title here so that no matter <em>when</em> I make my daily note, the title in the note matches the file title. For example, I might create tomorrow&rsquo;s daily note ahead of time to start taking notes for tomorrow, so I want the file title to be the date used, NOT today&rsquo;s date during note creation.</li>
<li>Reference format - the date format for #3</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="description-4">Description</h3>
<p>I like having a Daily Log section to rapid log tasks, ideas, notes, etc. throughout the day. I added a button to help me do this for two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>I use Obsidian mobile, and often view notes in reading mode from my phone. Having the button allows me to quickly capture a log even from reading mode</li>
<li>I like having a timestamp for my log entries. It forces a chronological log I can look back on.</li>
</ol>
<p>I described how I configured the QuickAdd macro above in the <a href="#quickadd">QuickAdd Plugin section</a>. Once the QuickAdd macro is configured, I can add the Button to my template and use the <code>command</code> type to call my QuickAdd macro.</p>
<p>I do often add things to my daily note without using the &ldquo;Add to Log&rdquo; button. This section is where I create and store my tasks 97% of the time. That way, my task location is the daily note, so I can easily see the date it was created and I get the associated context of everything else stored in my daily note.</p>

<h4 id="setting-up-css-snippets-for-callout-styles">Setting Up CSS Snippets for Callout Styles</h4>
<p>Before I get into the task queries for the template, I&rsquo;ll mention that I use callouts to contain my task queries because I like the color-coded separation, and I like being able to collapse/expand my task lists. I have set up custom callout styles that I&rsquo;ve tailored to my task system. The default styles would work fine too, but you can set up custom styles with CSS Snippets.</p>
<p>I followed the docs <a href="https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Callouts#Customize+callouts">here</a> to get this set up.</p>
<p>Under &ldquo;Appearance &gt; CSS Snippets&rdquo;, click the folder icon to open your snippets folder (.obsidian/snippets).</p>
<p>In this location, create a file called callouts.css that contains the following:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>.callout[data-callout=&quot;overdue&quot;] {
  --callout-color: 255, 215, 0;
  --callout-icon: alarm-clock;
}

.callout[data-callout=&quot;due-today&quot;] {
  --callout-color: 12, 248, 161;
  --callout-icon: check-square;
}

.callout[data-callout=&quot;coming-soon&quot;] {
  --callout-color: 37, 202, 227;
  --callout-icon: timer;
}

.callout[data-callout=&quot;next-two-weeks&quot;] {
  --callout-color: 42, 165, 227;
  --callout-icon: hourglass;
}

.callout[data-callout=&quot;later&quot;] {
  --callout-color: 127, 128, 222;
  --callout-icon: calendar;
}

.callout[data-callout=&quot;no-date&quot;] {
  --callout-color: 163, 80, 250;
  --callout-icon: calendar-off;
}

.callout[data-callout=&quot;recurring&quot;] {
  --callout-color: 216, 191, 216;
  --callout-icon: repeat;
}

.callout[data-callout=&quot;personal&quot;] {
  --callout-color: 240, 240, 240;
  --callout-icon: user;
}

.callout[data-callout=&quot;work&quot;] {
  --callout-color: 240, 240, 240;
  --callout-icon: briefcase;
}
</code></pre><p>Go back to &ldquo;Appearance &gt; CSS Snippets&rdquo; and click the refresh icon to reload the snippets into Obsidian&rsquo;s styles.</p>
<p>Now you can use these callout type identifiers to style your callouts. These are the custom callout types I use to contain different types of tasks. I don&rsquo;t use all of these in my daily note, some show up in other places like my Tasks Dashboard.</p>
<h4 id="grouping-tasks">Grouping Tasks</h4>
<p>For my daily note, I like my task queries to show tasks in a certain date range (e.g., overdue, due today, due in the next 3 days, completed today) and then within the query, I like to group my tasks by whether they are related to work, personal, or uncategorized. I use tags to assign my tasks to projects, so I look at the tag to determine which group a task should fall into.</p>
<p>My tag structure for organizing tasks has three sections: <code>#{prefix}/{area}/{project}</code>. An example tag would be: <code>#p/personal/website</code>. I prefix all project tags with <code>p/</code> so that I can quickly pull them all up in the typeahead menu when I start typing a tag. The second part of the tag is the area that the project belongs to, which is either &ldquo;work&rdquo; or &ldquo;personal&rdquo; in my setup. This is what I like to group my tasks on.</p>
<p>To accomplish this, at the end of my tasks query I have:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>group by function task.tags.map( (tag) =&gt; tag.split('/')[1] ? tag.split('/').slice(0, 2).join('/') : '')
</code></pre><p>Here&rsquo;s what this is doing for each task:</p>
<ul>
<li>it looks to see, &ldquo;Does this task have a tag with an area section?&rdquo;</li>
<li>if it does, it cuts off the project from the end, and returns the area like: <code>#{prefix}/{area}</code></li>
<li>if it does not, it returns empty</li>
</ul>
<p>So then my tasks fall into one of 3 groups:</p>
<ol>
<li>Personal</li>
<li>Work</li>
<li>Uncategorized</li>
</ol>
<p>My &ldquo;due soon&rdquo; tasks query takes grouping even further, and groups tasks first by their due date and then sub-groups into the areas I defined above.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://www.esv.org/Proverbs+31/">Proverbs 31/31</a> Advice to King Lemuel from his mother: Don&rsquo;t spend your time pursuing women; this has brought down many kings. Kings should not get drunk so they do not tear down what they created while sober. Speak for those who do not have a voice. Judge justly and defend the rights of the poor. A wonderful spouse is rare. They can be trusted and have a good work ethic. Always they provide for their family and plan for their future. They are confident and strong. They help the poor and are not afraid of hard times for which they have prepared. From their mouth flows wisdom and kindness. They are praised by their children and their spouses. Charm and beauty are fleeting, but a spouse who reveres God is praiseworthy. They will get back more than they have put in.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://www.esv.org/Proverbs+30/">Proverbs 30/31</a> God&rsquo;s word is true; don&rsquo;t add to it. Stay away from lying and fakeness. Don&rsquo;t become rich and forget who God is. Don&rsquo;t become poor and steal, disrespecting God. Some think themselves clean while covered in filth. Greed is never content; give, and it wants more. If you mock your father, mother, and all authority, there will be consequences. Being suddenly put in a situation for which one is deeply unqualified will lead to disaster. Even small things can be wise; ants, groundhogs, locusts, lizards. The beloved leader walks with the confidence of the lion. If you have been foolish or planning to do evil, restrain yourself. Pressing anger produces strife.</p>

The good understand the rights of the poor. A fool indulges every passion of their spirit, but one with wisdom quietly holds themself back. The proud will be brought low, and the humble will be raised in honor. Fear is a cage, but one who trusts God is free. We look to judges for justice, but it can only truly be given by God.

One that hides their sins will not prosper, but one that owns up to them and turns away will receive mercy. An unwise leader oppresses cruelly, but one who hates unjust gain will prolong their time. The faithful one abounds with blessings, but one who cheats for their own gain will be punished. Whoever puts their faith in their mind is a fool, but those that walk in wisdom will do well.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://www.esv.org/Proverbs+27/">Proverbs 27/31</a> Don&rsquo;t brag about your future, it is not guaranteed. Praise from one&rsquo;s own mouth is not valid; let it come from another. Be cautious of anger and jealousy; it is difficult to stand against them. True love includes rebuke when needed. An enemy can feign love with kind words. Everything tastes good to one who is hungry. The goodness of a friend comes from their authentic advice. A close neighbor is better than a far brother. When and where you act is just as important as how. Friends sharpen each other like iron on iron. As gold is refined in the furnace, one is tested by their praise.

Do not meddle in other people&rsquo;s fights. Fire dies without wood, and strife dies without a gossiper.

			 <p><a href="https://www.esv.org/Proverbs+20/">Proverbs 20/31</a> Do not be led astray by drunkenness. It is honorable to keep from quarreling. Many proclaim steadfast love, but it is difficult to find one truly faithful. Who can confidently say their heart is pure? Even a child is known by their acts, evil or good. Plans come to fruition when advice is sought. Do not take revenge on evil, leave it to God. Reflect before you give your word. The young prize their strength and beauty, the old prize their wisdom.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://www.esv.org/Proverbs+18/">Proverbs 18/31</a> Fools take pleasure in expressing only their own opinions. Humility comes before honor. It is shameful to give an answer before one hears. Giving gifts will bring you into the presence of the great. The one who states their case first seems right, until examined by another. Words have the power of death and life. Better to have one friend who sticks close than many friends.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://www.esv.org/Proverbs+17/">Proverbs 17/31</a> (Poor + peace) &gt; (rich + strife). Judging the poor insults your creator. Be careful offering bribes, lest you come to depend on them. It is loving to forgive, you will lose friends if you rehash old wounds. A reprimand to the wise penetrates further than a beating to a fool. Friends love through highs and lows. Joy is good medicine, but a crushed spirit is crippling. Those with a calm spirit have understanding.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://www.esv.org/Proverbs+16/">Proverbs 16/31</a> Every person thinks themselves right, but God weighs the spirit. Commit your work to God and it will be established. Everything is for a purpose, even the wicked. One turns from evil through reverence to God. When a man follows the ways of God, he is at peace even with his enemies. People plan, God establishes. You will discover good things if you ponder the word. Gracious words are sweet to the soul. One&rsquo;s appetite urges them on. A whisperer separates close friends.

			 <p><a href="https://www.esv.org/Proverbs+15/">Proverbs 15/31</a> A gentle response cools anger, but a harsh response stirs it up. If God knows the depths of hell, how much more does he know the depths of your heart? The cheerful heart has a continuous feast. (Poor + God) &gt; (Rich + Trouble). (Lettuce + Love) &gt; (Filet Mignon + Hatred). The path is easy for the upright, but for the idle, it is like walking through thorns. Plans fail without counsel, but with many advisors, they succeed. The Lord destroys the house of the arrogant but protects the house of the humble. He who hates bribes will live. The heart of the righteous ponders, but the mouth of the wicked pours out. Reverence for God is instruction in wisdom. Humility comes before honor.</p>

A cynic seeks wisdom in vain, but it comes easy for one of understanding. Run from fools. Fools mock those who seek forgiveness, but the upright find it. No one knows your heart like you. Life is both joy and grief, together. The wise are cautious, but fools are reckless. Blessed are those generous to the poor. A ruler is only as good as their people. Be slow to anger. Envy will rot your core.</p>

Prudent ones act with knowledge, but fools flaunt their folly. If disaster pursues you, consider living righteously. One who walks with the wise becomes wise, but a friend of fools hurts themselves.

A fool is right in his own eyes, but the wise listens to advice. The wise ignore insults, but a fool is clear about their rage. The words of the fool damage, the words of the wise heal.

Multitudes of words indicate wrongdoing, the prudent one restrains their lips. The righteous feed many while fools die for their lack of understanding. The wicked get what they dread, the righteous get what they desire. The way of the Lord is a fortress for the good, but destruction for the evil.</p>

			 <p>Below are some thoughts I typed up the morning before my wife was induced for our first child. I recall feeling especially reflective that morning, and I was trying to prepare myself for what was ahead (note: I was/am still unprepared, but I&rsquo;ve managed to figure things out on the fly so far).</p>
<h1 id="2023-07-05-thoughts-on-the-day-of-the-induction">2023-07-05 Thoughts on the Day of the Induction</h1>
<p>Soon I am going to be a dad and my wife is going to be a mom. It is strange how major change can be right in front of my face, and yet it is hard to believe that it is coming. But how will things change? How can I know what change will be like before it has made its way into my life and started to rearrange things I once cared for? Will I be sad at losing things? Certain freedoms? Or will my values and beliefs be changed?</p>
<p>It feels more like the latter, but I have no idea how that will play out. I think I will miss some freedoms from before having a baby, like getting sleep whenever I want, but on the whole, I think this will be a good change and I am really looking forward to it.</p>
<p>Here is what I think <em>will change</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Less sleep, especially early on</li>
<li>I will develop a larger capacity for love</li>
<li>If I do it right, I will slow down and see the world through a child&rsquo;s eyes once again</li>
<li>Life will become less flexible in some ways - not able to disc golf as much, trickier to go into the office for work, etc.</li>
<li>My wife and I will need to unite around a common goal in a way that we really haven&rsquo;t had to before</li>
<li>Less time to myself</li>
<li>More laughter</li>
<li>Really more of all emotions. I think life will become more vivid and intense, as long as I lean in</li>
<li>More walks (I am really excited to use the fancy stroller we got 😂)</li>
<li>Less of an aversion to grossness. Getting accustomed to changing dirty diapers and getting poo/pee on myself</li>
<li>More wonder and awe</li>
<li>More prioritizing family. It is easy to dive into work and get consumed with projects I am working on, but I think it will become easier/more important to be giving myself to my family</li>
<li>Less self-centeredness</li>
<li>Less screen time (This will not magically change on its own, but I will be focusing on this. I do NOT want to be the dad that has his face in his phone while his daughter is wanting to be seen by him.)</li>
<li>My WHY will be strengthened. I will have more purpose and conviction behind my actions.</li>
<li>The burden of responsibility on my shoulders will be increased</li>
</ul>
<p>Someday when my daughter describes her dad <em>I hope she will say</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>He loved me</li>
<li>We had so much fun together</li>
<li>He was goofy and embarrassed me in school</li>
<li>He was my example for following Jesus</li>
<li>He showed me how a good man should treat me</li>
<li>He could beat up all the other dads 😂</li>
<li>He was there when I needed a shoulder to cry on</li>
<li>He got out of his comfort zone to try things I wanted to do</li>
<li>He didn&rsquo;t raise his voice at me unless he had to keep me safe</li>
<li>He loved mom</li>
<li>He encouraged my interests</li>
<li>He taught me right from wrong</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="reflections">Reflections</h1>
<p>Now that I my daughter is over 5 months old, I&rsquo;m impressed with my past self that most of his predictions were pretty close. I&rsquo;d like to reflect on some of what I got right/wrong.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Will I be sad at losing things? Certain freedoms? Or will my values and beliefs be changed?</p>
<p>It feels more like the latter, but I have no idea how that will play out.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have found it to be true that my values have shifted some. It was not such a big and dramatic immediate change as I had expected, but I have not felt sad about losing any freedoms from before my daughter was born.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I will develop a larger capacity for love</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if my capacity for love is larger or not, but close moments with her do hit differently. Baby giggles or moments when it is just the two of us looking into each other&rsquo;s eyes make my heart so full.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If I do it right, I will slow down and see the world through a child&rsquo;s eyes once again</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am still working on this, and I want to do this more. I think I will be forced into this soon, as she will begin crawling in the next couple of months, so I&rsquo;m going to need to put my baby cap on to identify all the hazards we may still have on the floors.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My wife and I will need to unite around a common goal in a way that we really haven&rsquo;t had to before</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes. Having a baby has been very uniting, but also brings about a number of disagreements over strongly held opinions on parenting. So far, we have centered around &ldquo;safety&rdquo; as our tiebreaker to determine which opinion we should go with when we can&rsquo;t come to agreement through talking about it. It is interesting that so many of our opinions are rooted in our own childhood experiences, so in a lot of our disagreements it is more important to empathize with each other about past experiences than to rationalize about the current situation. When we empathize, we both tend to feel much better about the approach we decide on. The core to all of this is a mutual understanding that we are on the same team, and we both want the best for our daughter, even when we are coming at it from different angles.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Less time to myself</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finding time for <em>me</em> has become much more challenging. The only alone time I&rsquo;ve found has come early in the morning, before the girls are awake. Surprisingly though, changing diapers in the middle of the night has made it <em>easier</em> to get up early. It has been very refreshing for me to get up around 4:30 or 5:00, make a warm cup of coffee, and then either journal, read a book, or work on a personal project. I&rsquo;d like to incorporate more exercise into my &ldquo;me time&rdquo;, but the time feels so short and I&rsquo;m having way more fun doing stuff like writing this post. I know I will feel so much better if I just suck it up and do the exercise though, and I can find ways to be fast and still have time for the other things I enjoy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Really more of all emotions. I think life will become more vivid and intense, as long as I lean in</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When I can keep myself free from attention-grabbing distractions (looking at you, phone) and I can focus my whole being on time with my family, this is true. I have found that I am still just as prone toward distraction though, and while I get distracted with flashy colors and noises (YouTube), the color in front of my eyes slowly sucks the color out of life around me. I feel grayer and duller when I am giving into distractions. It is sad that this numbing has become the norm in our society, with so many of us getting off of work and going straight to TV, phone, video games, you name it. I think my disclaimer &ldquo;as long as I lean in&rdquo;, holds true here. I need to constantly check in with myself to be sure that I am leaning in.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>More walks (I am really excited to use the fancy stroller we got 😂)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This has saved me from my lack of a workout routine. What I didn&rsquo;t account for, though, was how much I&rsquo;d be walking around the house carrying the baby. That is a workout in itself! I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve gained strength in my upper body, but my endurance is way higher now that I am carrying a baby all the time.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>More prioritizing family. It is easy to dive into work and get consumed with projects I am working on, but I think it will become easier/more important to be giving myself to my family</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This has not come automatically. I&rsquo;ve tried to do this, but I have to really work for it. Work issues can seem so urgent, and personal projects can feel so much more fun than changing diapers. I must patiently remind myself of the value of being with my family when other things are constantly pulling at me. This value is realized on a scale of years, or even decades, when my family will be able to look back and see how much I loved them, even in the little moments. This perspective is hard to have when so many other things feel like they need my attention NOW and I could see results on them right away.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The burden of responsibility on my shoulders will be increased</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This sounds so serious and heavy lol. Yes this is true, but I haven&rsquo;t felt weighed down at all.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Someday when my daughter describes her dad <em>I hope she will say</em>:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I won&rsquo;t be able to reflect on the real-life outcomes of this section for another 20+ years. But all of these hopes are still true. I was emotional as I wrote it originally, and I am emotional again thinking about this. It really all boils down to: <em>I hope she feels loved by me, and I hope she reciprocates it</em>. It feels scary to think that one or both of these could not be true in 20+ years. But I get emotional thinking about how joyful I will be if both are true.</p>
<p>All in all, being a dad has been awesome. I would do it again, but not anytime too soon. Right now I am perfectly content with just having one daughter and learning how to love her well.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve never considered my handwriting to be great, but I&rsquo;ve been doing a lot more writing by hand recently so I resolved to make an effort to write more legibly.</p>
<p>The first thing I tried was to add more space between each character and each word, and that alone made a huge difference! Actually, it&rsquo;s enough of an improvement that I&rsquo;m content with my handwriting for now and won&rsquo;t be trying any more improvements for a while. Keeping some level of messiness feels necessary to maintain the <em>soul</em> of my style.</p>
<p>Focusing on pushing my hand out to the right to separate each character has made my writing feel like it flows a lot better. I think before I was overly focused on cramming each word tightly together so I could maximize the space on each page. In fact, since making this change, part of me still feels guilty for taking up more space on the page with each word. Somehow it feels wasteful, and I&rsquo;m surprised I could feel guilty about something so trivial. I try to remind myself that whitespace has value too. It brings separation, clarity. It lays the canvas from which each character or word is defined. Having too much ink smushed together muddles everything up. Each stroke is only as good as the accompanying whitespace that makes it a stroke at all.</p>
<p>As I think about whitespace in a literal sense and how it has improved my writing, it makes me wonder about whitespace in a figurative sense. Are there areas in my life where I am trying too hard to cram &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; together, and a little whitespace might bring separation and clarity? What does whitespace even mean, in that sense?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve always journaled in some capacity, but I&rsquo;ve really gotten back into it recently. I&rsquo;m bullet journaling daily, partially to track personal to-dos, partially to log what is happening each day, but mostly to force myself to review what is happening each month and each day. The slowness of the practice helps me retain my schedule better in my brain. I&rsquo;m also doing morning pages most mornings to declutter my mind at the start of each day. As part of this renewed interest in journaling, I&rsquo;ve gotten back into fountain pens. Right now, I&rsquo;m using a <a href="https://a.co/d/elJ2Eby">Lamy Safari</a> with <a href="https://a.co/d/8rP2yg2">Diamine Red Dragon</a> ink.</p>
