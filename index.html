			 <p>My week summarized into 3 highlights, 2 discoveries, and 1 anticipation. It&rsquo;s been a while! It feels good to be writing a weeknote again!## 3 Highlights<strong>10x10 Supersonic Wind Tunnel and SLOPE Lab Tours</strong> I coordinated tours for my team to visit the <a href="https://www1.grc.nasa.gov/facilities/10x10/">10x10 Supersonic Wind Tunnel</a> and <a href="https://www1.grc.nasa.gov/facilities/slope-lab/#turbomachinery-facilities">SLOPE Lab</a> at NASA Glenn Research Center. The wind tunnel was incredible. It&rsquo;s the largest wind tunnel capable of supersonic speeds in the country, and can push close to Mach 5. The tunnel complex is spread around 4 acres, as the tunnels weave in and out of buildings containing things like motors, compressors, an air dryer, and more. My favorite part of that tour was getting to see the results of a recent mishap they had. I am the product manager for NASA&rsquo;s Mishap Information System, so I see incidents reported in our system all the time, but it is a completely different story to see the aftermath of a mishap in-person. I can&rsquo;t go into detail about the mishap, but luckily nobody was injured, although it had the potential for severe injuries.The SLOPE Lab was also a great tour. I had visited before, but it&rsquo;s always neat to get a refresher on the history of tire design for space-faring rovers. Our tour guide was responsible for designing simulated lunar soil as part of her PhD, and I enjoyed listening to her passionately explain the process of simulating lunar regolith based on data collected from the Apollo missions. It&rsquo;s also fun to get to handle and manipulate their fancy shape-memory alloy springs, which always return to their original shape. Materials science is way over my head, but utterly fascinating.The best part of both tours was being able to make the time to provide these tours for my team. Most team members had not seen these facilities before and these tours are great for helping us all feel more connected to NASA&rsquo;s mission. And on top of that they&rsquo;re just really friggin' cool.<strong>Ping Pong</strong>I&rsquo;m working in the office full-time now. One of the silver linings is that I discovered our building has a ping pong table that sat idle for years.And idle it shall no longer be.<a href="https://www.killerspin.com/products/jet-black-combo">I have my own paddle</a> that I bought a few years back which has also been collecting dust, so I&rsquo;m glad to finally get some use out of it! Having ping pong as an active way to pass the time during lunch breaks is such a relief. I&rsquo;ve already found a few other folks in the office that are excited to play, and one of my coworkers played competitively in tournaments in the open division in the past. He&rsquo;ll definitely whoop my butt (already has), but I&rsquo;m excited to play with him and others to sharpen my game and have some fun while at the office.<em>Semi-related: I also found a golf range nearby the office and went with a coworker this week. I&rsquo;d like to put a little more time into my golf game this year and finally fix my slice! I&rsquo;ve never gone to the range much and only play a couple of times a year&hellip; and it shows.</em> <strong>Swimming Lessons</strong>My daughter had her third swimming lesson this week. I&rsquo;ve looked forward to this every week since it started. She <strong>loves</strong> the water and has been doing great! This week she got a little carried away and took off sprinting around the pool while we were practicing getting in and out of the pool. I had to jump up out of the pool quickly to go catch her. My repeated utterances of &ldquo;Stop! Come back!&rdquo; had no effect, much to my dismay. But other than that, she has been doing great, and swimming lessons have been a wonderful way for our little family to spend time together learning in a fun way.We also have some friends who enrolled their kids in the same class, so it has been fun to go through it together! And we get access to the rec center&rsquo;s pool after lessons, so that has been a fun time to let the kids splash in the shallow end while we parents catch up with each other.## 2 Discoveries<strong>Airless Bike Tires</strong>There was a recent <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/smarttirecompany/space-age-bicycle-wheels-using-nasa-technology">Kickstarter campaign for airless bike tires</a> based on the wheel design for recent rovers. Apparently an intern at the SLOPE Lab used their internship to develop bike tires based on the interwoven shape-memory alloy spring design used on rover tires. After proving this could work, that intern sold their design to <a href="https://smarttirecompany.com/">The SMART Tire Company</a>, who is now trying to reduce production costs and commercialize the design.This is a great example of how NASA science discoveries often spin off into great commercial opportunities here on earth. For more, check out <a href="https://spinoff.nasa.gov/.**Libby**I'm">spinoff.nasa.gov/.*<em>Libby</em>&hellip;</a> very late to the game on this one, but I <em>finally</em> discovered <a href="https://help.libbyapp.com/en-us/6103.htm?tocpath=Home%7CGetting%20started%7C_____1">Libby</a>. Libby lets you connect your library card(s) to enjoy free ebooks and audiobooks. I&rsquo;ve used other library apps, but I&rsquo;m liking Libby much better so far.With my new commute, I&rsquo;m trying to transform myself into an audiobook guy. I much prefer reading visually so I can go over things slowly and take notes, but I&rsquo;m adjusting to the audio format. The new audiobook feature on Spotify had me all excited, but then I realized there was a limit on how much I could listen to each month. Boo. So now I&rsquo;m using Libby instead. Another nice perk of Libby is that I can set bookmarks and highlights in audiobooks, to take notes. So in theory, it should be pretty easy to bookmark something that stuck out to me while driving, and then I can come back to it later to take notes and export those notes outside of Libby. I&rsquo;ve yet to test that process, but it seems like it will work, and I&rsquo;m excited to figure it out.Another awesome feature of Libby is that it can send ebooks straight to your Kindle, so there&rsquo;s no need to read ebooks on my phone. I just tested it out this morning with &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy_(novel)">The Hitchhiker&rsquo;s Guide to the Galaxy</a>&rdquo;, and it seemed to work great. I&rsquo;m curious to see what happens to all my notes and highlights when I need to &ldquo;return&rdquo; the ebook. To avoid heartbreak and be safe, I&rsquo;m going to export all my highlights and notes before returning the book, but I&rsquo;m hoping they all stay in the Kindle app somehow.## 1 Anticipation<strong>NASA&rsquo;s Reduction in Force Plan</strong>NASA is due to submit their Reductions in Force (RIF) plan this upcoming week. The deadline across the government was March 13, but NASA got an extension until March 20 due to all the space activities this week, including the Crew 10 mission to the International Space Station, a lunar landing, and more. For those interested, here is the <a href="https://www.chcoc.gov/content/guidance-agency-rif-and-reorganization-plans-requested-implementing-president%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%9Cdepartment">OPM memo</a> that spells out the steps agencies need to take to reduce their workforce and restructure.I&rsquo;m not sure what to expect for this RIF. It&rsquo;s hard to tell whether my position would be affected or not, as it all depends on which areas they target for reductions. Some folks around me are very worried about their jobs.But truth be told, I feel at peace with it. Despite how chaotic things are on the ground, I believe there is a God who is over it all. What comes will come, and I&rsquo;ll figure it out. The only certain thing is change is coming, one way or another.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Trying something new here. I&rsquo;m gonna call it a commute post. It&rsquo;s 6:18 a.m. on Wednesday, March 5th. I&rsquo;m driving into work for the morning. I&rsquo;ve got probably like 42 minutes until I get into work, so I figured, instead of just listening to music or a podcast or a book, I would try talking to my phone and do a blog post just talking out loud, which is something I&rsquo;ve never tried before. With coming into the office more and having a longer commute, I&rsquo;ve found it harder and harder to have time to just sit down and write, so I wanted to try something different, shake things up, and see how this format works.</p>
<p>In thinking about it, I was trying to figure out what type of topics would work to just talk about in a car because I feel like typically, when I&rsquo;m writing, I have some idea or concept, or maybe even just a concept of a title in my mind, and through writing about it, I&rsquo;m thinking about new angles or counterpoints. Through the writing, I figure out what I&rsquo;m actually writing about. I typically never start with a completely coherent vision, so I wasn&rsquo;t sure how it would work just talking through that. I had some fears of just sounding dumb, to be quite frank, of working through those things in real time.</p>
<p>After thinking about it, I thought a topic that might work would be just telling stories from my life, things that I&rsquo;ve told a couple times to different people that might be interesting to just have up on the blog and have a record of for myself. As time goes on, I get further and further from each of these stories, and some of the details slip away a little bit more, so I want to memorialize them on the blog. I also want to be able to share them out with family or friends, or whoever.</p>
<p>For this first one, I figured I would start with something easy, and something that comes up through work a lot - just talking about how I got into the line of work that I&rsquo;m in now. I now work at NASA as a product manager. I own a few of the products at the NASA Safety Center. That includes the NASA Mishap Information System and the NASA Cause Analysis Tool. These are all applications for safety personnel at NASA to use, mostly for data entry and storage for mishaps that happen at NASA. These could be anything from something as small as someone trips and falls, where we need a record of that injury even if it&rsquo;s just a skinned knee, all the way up to millions of dollars of property damage if we lose a satellite or something along those lines.</p>
<p>I came from a computer science and software background in college and was a software engineer right out of college. But how about I start back at the beginning and talk about where things started, at least in my mind, and then progress through the windy road in my career to where I ended up.</p>
<p>I wish I could hear more about other people in their career journeys, because I feel like every single person that I&rsquo;ve talked to - when I asked them about where they are now and how they got there - almost nobody had just a clear vision and followed it to a T and knew exactly where they would be. It seems like everybody has this very windy, very interesting path where they&rsquo;re sort of going along slowly and finding their way. And that&rsquo;s how it happened for me, too.</p>
<h2 id="the-first-spark">The First Spark</h2>
<p>I think a good place to start would be sometime between when I was 7 or 16 years old. I would say I was probably around 11 when my dad bought me a Python programming book for kids. Which sounds like the perfect start to the story for someone in my line of work. But while I&rsquo;m picking this as the beginning, it seemed, and I think really was, pretty inconsequential at the time because he bought me this book when I was 11, and I really just didn&rsquo;t care for it at all. It felt like more school to me, and I just wanted to go outside and play.</p>
<p>I think I looked at it maybe three times. We might have attempted together to do the different coding exercises in the book - they had little games to show you how to code but also make it fun. I think maybe we did one of those, and then I thought, &ldquo;Man, screw this, I&rsquo;m gonna go outside and play.&rdquo; So that was all that really was at that point in my life. But it&rsquo;s still something that I remember and think back on as maybe something that opened up my eyes and my mind to the possibility that coding is something that I could do.</p>
<h2 id="first-jobs-and-high-school">First Jobs and High School</h2>
<p>Fast forward to high school. It was time finally to get a job, and I had two places I was going to apply to. One was a little restaurant right down the road from my parents' place where I had applied to be a dishwasher. The other was Chipotle, where they just had some jobs that opened up. I don&rsquo;t remember exactly how it went, but I believe before I even had an offer at Chipotle, I called the restaurant right away and said, &ldquo;Hey, you know what? I&rsquo;m not interested anymore. I&rsquo;m going to go work at Chipotle.&rdquo; I basically broke up with them right then and there.</p>
<p>I went and told my mom about it, and she was not happy because I had nothing solidified at that point. She said, &ldquo;You call them back right now and tell them that you&rsquo;re still interested in the job.&rdquo; So I very sheepishly got back on the phone, called that restaurant back, and asked if I could still be considered to work there. I don&rsquo;t remember if I had an offer at the time - I think I might have.</p>
<p>The way it ended up working out was that I did get a job at Chipotle Mexican Grill. I worked there through a lot of high school. I think it was my junior and senior year, and I think I came back maybe on one winter break in college as well.</p>
<p>It was an interesting place to work. Anyone who&rsquo;s been in food service will know it&rsquo;s hot and fast-paced. And I am not really a fast-paced person. As you can probably imagine, someone who takes time to sit slowly and write on a blog - I&rsquo;m more in my head and like to really think through things and understand them. There&rsquo;s some of that working at Chipotle, but a lot of it was just &ldquo;get these burritos out and get them out fast.&rdquo; So it was an interesting time of my life. I enjoyed the people, and I definitely enjoyed sampling the food, but I could tell that wasn&rsquo;t anything I wanted to do long term.</p>
<h2 id="college-decisions">College Decisions</h2>
<p>Shortly before college, there&rsquo;s that period where you know college is ahead of you and you&rsquo;re trying to figure out what you want to be for the rest of your life. Who am I? Where am I going? Wrestling with all these big questions and trying to figure out what my major should be.</p>
<p>I had already been thinking about something along the lines of psychology, and I think what probably got me there was being raised in the church and very much thinking about and constantly hearing messages about serving and helping other people. That was something that I felt called to, and I felt was really important and interesting. I didn&rsquo;t quite want to go into the church to be a pastor. It seemed weird to me to mix my income with my place of worship - it just wasn&rsquo;t something for me.</p>
<p>Something that further confirmed that idea of going into psychology was that our church actually did these surveys where it would give you recommendations about what your job would be. I took this survey and the three recommendations were: youth pastor, bartender, and psychologist. I already had decided I didn&rsquo;t want to do the youth pastor. The bartender - I thought, &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s interesting, but I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s for me.&rdquo; And that kind of just confirmed further that maybe I should go and get a psychology degree.</p>
<h2 id="psychology-to-programming">Psychology to Programming</h2>
<p>So I went to college for psychology for my first year. In the spring semester of that year, I got a job working as an undergraduate research assistant in a psychology lab. I went to Kent State University, and Manfred van Dolman had the Van Dolman lab. The general focus was romantic relationships, but I got to work on a bunch of interesting studies.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t super involved - it was more so helping with data collection or running different sessions with participants. Some of the things I did: they would have couples go into a room by themselves and just answer questions together. Some of it was about splitting housework - how would they do that? Sometimes these were people who already lived together, sometimes it wasn&rsquo;t. They&rsquo;d also dream about their future. One of my jobs was to just watch these recordings and transcribe them. This was before easy transcription services or AI, so I was just in there listening to all these conversations between my peers trying to figure out relationships.</p>
<p>Another study was an eye movement study, where I would bring participants into a room. We had a computer set up with a face harness in front of it so they would set their chin on there, kind of like if you go to the eye doctor. Right underneath or below the monitor, there was a camera that was positioned at their eyes. I would get that all configured with their eyes so I could figure out where they&rsquo;re looking on the screen, and then I would leave and just play some images up on the screen and see what they looked at. I think it was images either of males and females just alone or together as couples, and the study was trying to look at where you&rsquo;re looking - are you looking at the person&rsquo;s face, their body, something else?</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t stay around at the lab long enough to find the results of that study, but that was another interesting one to be a part of. But part of working in that lab, one of the things I got to do that definitely led me to where I am now was data coding. All this data they would get at the end, I would have it in a big Excel sheet and aggregate it, and they had some program where they would analyze this data. The grad students had always done it pretty much manually, or they would have one of their undergrad research assistants do it manually, but I found that through this program, it had a little section where you could write scripts to automate some of the manual work that we were doing.</p>
<p>So I got to work figuring out how to do that and implemented it for the lab, which sped up the data analysis process for the whole lab, and for me too. I didn&rsquo;t have to sit there doing all this mindless work going through each data element and analyzing and coding and tagging each thing. That was maybe the first thing that really piqued my interest - like, &ldquo;Oh, this is really rewarding to be able to just write something on the computer, make the computer do things for me.&rdquo; It was just a small task that I could accomplish, and in the end, I can see that it worked, and now it&rsquo;s done. I found that really rewarding.</p>
<p>I was doing that and enjoying it, but also while I was working in the lab, I was observing these grad students who were doing their research and just observing that I don&rsquo;t think this was the future for me. They were spending a lot of time in the lab. They seemed stressed. They were all working on their papers - I helped them some with their papers and references at the bottom and the slog of all of that and the research - and I just thought, &ldquo;Man, I don&rsquo;t know if this is for me, and if I can do this, and if this is what I want.&rdquo; Especially the way I was thinking of going, becoming an actual psychologist, it was almost guaranteed that I would need to go to some sort of graduate school, and just my undergraduate degree wouldn&rsquo;t get me very far.</p>
<h2 id="changing-direction">Changing Direction</h2>
<p>So thinking about what would come with having to go to grad school, as I neared the end of the semester and got into summer, I was like, &ldquo;Man, I really need to figure something else out because this is just not going to work for me.&rdquo; I was thinking, &ldquo;Well, if not psychology, what the heck do I do?&rdquo; because that was the plan that I went to college with, and I had nothing else in mind.</p>
<p>But then I thought back to the data coding in the lab that I enjoyed doing, which was basically just writing little scripts in Excel, and then I thought back to that Python book that my dad had got me when I was a kid, and how even though I paid no attention to it really at the time, it was memorable enough that it stuck with me even now. So I was like, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Maybe there&rsquo;s something here to explore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I think I went and looked for the Python book and never found it. I don&rsquo;t know if we donated the book or not. I don&rsquo;t know what ever happened to it. It&rsquo;s like a ghost. I really - maybe it didn&rsquo;t even happen, and I made the whole thing up. I&rsquo;ll have to double check with my dad. I&rsquo;m pretty sure it&rsquo;s real, but I&rsquo;ve never found the book. But it was memorable.</p>
<p>So that summer what I started to do was go on the internet and YouTube and just looked up like &ldquo;coding - where do you start? What is it? How does it work?&rdquo; and just started to play with it some myself just to figure out what it was about, what the possibilities were with the career. I had a lot of fun that summer making just some little tiny web projects, really nothing too fancy because I had no actual experience coding and didn&rsquo;t understand any of the basic fundamentals. I would just follow along precisely with what they were doing. It was probably really only HTML and CSS, so I&rsquo;m not even programming, but just displaying a simple web page. But I had a lot of fun with that, just figuring out how to place the elements on the screen, style them, and make it all work together. I was like, &ldquo;Man, this is really cool.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="digital-sciences-and-first-internship">Digital Sciences and First Internship</h2>
<p>So I just went for it and switched my major. Kent State had something called digital sciences, which I appreciate. It was very similar to computer science, but you drop some of the high level calculus and more theoretical or sciency computer classes and trade them out for more cross-functional classes based on a focus area. So I was digital sciences with a focus on software development. The types of cross-functional courses I got to take: one was in requirements gathering - how do you do that and get requirements for a software project? I got to take a class on design, and a class on just building a web project together, which was really cool.</p>
<p>We built an XR mobile app. Kent State, if you don&rsquo;t know, had a really bad shooting back in the day, and they have all sorts of memorabilia or artifacts from that day archived back in a room. If you go request it, you can go see them - gas masks, bullet casings, and various things from that day. We got to go back into that room and see those, and we scanned them with a phone to make 3D digital artifacts. Through this app, we were able to display these 3D artifacts. We had these pedestals we set up in a room, we put QR codes on the pedestals, and then folks would come into the room, grab an iPad, and could point at the pedestal with the iPad. The pedestal was empty, kind of as an artistic representation of the lives that were lost, or the emptiness of that day, but you could still point your iPad at it and see this sort of ghostly 3D artifact rendering of different objects from that day, which was really cool. You could turn them around, and you could zoom in on them and take a look at them. It was opened up to the public so people could come in and see it, which they might not otherwise be able to get access to.</p>
<p>That was a cool project, and it was just things like that that I got to do with that digital sciences major, which I really appreciated, and I feel like prepared me probably better than a plain computer science degree would for the career I went into.</p>
<p>In college, I went for an internship at a place called Taazaa. I don&rsquo;t remember how I found them. They were a little custom software shop in Hudson, Ohio, where different businesses would work with them for some website or different software product they would need, and this place would work with them and help them build it out.</p>
<p>I remember going to the interview for that internship, and typically for interviews for software engineering positions or technical positions, the interview will be very technical where they&rsquo;re asking you programming questions or almost like riddles to solve to make sure that you really understand technically what you&rsquo;re doing. They had some of those, and I&rsquo;m sure they, knowing that it was an intern position, kept them simple. Thinking back on them, they were very easy things I could do with my eyes closed now - very simple sort or FizzBuzz type problems.</p>
<p>But that was after I think I did that interview after maybe one semester of college or one semester of that major in digital sciences, and really, no programming experience beyond that. So, even these simple questions, I just bombed that interview. It was so bad. I remember walking out of that and just feeling so despondent and dejected, so embarrassed that I had even shown up.</p>
<p>That was rough, but I don&rsquo;t know why, even still, I thought, &ldquo;You know what? Maybe there&rsquo;s some chance that I can get this thing&rdquo; because I think I did okay just talking to the guy and letting him know what I&rsquo;m interested in, what I&rsquo;m doing, and listening to what they&rsquo;re doing and asking questions. It took him a long time to get back to me. I followed up with him, maybe twice a week or every week, for multiple weeks, until eventually they got back to me and said, &ldquo;Hey, do you want the job?&rdquo; And I said, &ldquo;Oh my gosh, yeah, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At some point, I asked him, &ldquo;Why me? Why did you give me that job because I feel like I did not do very good on the coding interview,&rdquo; and they said, &ldquo;You know what? You were the only person that followed up consistently. We had other people who did better on the technical interview, but they just didn&rsquo;t follow up, and we didn&rsquo;t see the same interest with them that you had.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hearing that was another one of those things like the Python programming book that really stuck with me throughout my career and my life - just that value of persistence and interest and energy. I think having those things - almost everything else will work out if you have those things, and people will really pay attention to that.</p>
<p>So, that was sort of a pivotal moment for me, but the internship itself when I got into it - I really liked the people and the place, they had some interesting work, but honestly I feel bad because I probably just was not ready to be working somewhere at that point. They were very generous with allowing me to use a lot of the paid internship time in training classes on top of my college work, to figure out specific skills related to the work they were doing, to learn how to do it and build some of my own prototypes before building actual things for clients.</p>
<p>I think I maybe did like one or two little pieces of a product for a client before I ended up leaving that internship, and I still feel bad. I left and got an internship at another place. I was there maybe eight months, and I could tell the look on their face when I said I was leaving. They were like, &ldquo;Are you serious? We spent all this time investing in you. Now, you&rsquo;re just gonna leave?&rdquo;</p>

<p>But something better came along. I was at a career fair at Kent State, and I had actually just gone to see the Taazaa guys. They had a booth there, and I was just gonna walk there to go visit them and talk with them. But I had some classes or something, and I got there towards the end of the career fair, and they had already packed up and left. So I was like, &ldquo;Oh well, shoot, that stinks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So I was walking out of the building, and then there was a Progressive Insurance booth. As I was walking by, one of them flagged me down and was like, &ldquo;Hey, want to hear about Progressive?&rdquo; And I was like, &ldquo;Oh yeah, sure, whatever, I got some time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So I was talking to them. I told them about the internship I&rsquo;m doing, the coursework I&rsquo;m doing, what I&rsquo;m interested in, and they were interested in having me back the next day. They would be doing interviews somewhere, and they invited me for an interview. I got in my resume, they invited me for interviews the next day, and I thought, &ldquo;All right, cool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So I went and did the interview there, which went really well. I think maybe I did another interview that went well, and then I got invited to their final round of interviews, which - as a junior in college at this time, maybe a senior - it was just mind-boggling to me for a Fortune 100 company, the expenses they went through for interns even just at the interview stage.</p>
<p>What ended up happening was all the candidates that had made it that far in the process, they brought us out to their headquarters. We were all local in the area, all college kids local. I don&rsquo;t think there was anyone outside of our commute, but they put us all up in a hotel. We got nice hotel rooms. They brought us onto their headquarters the next day. We got to tour around and see headquarters.</p>
<p>Progressive actually owns the largest privately held collection of art in the country. The guy who founded it loved art and used it as an investment for the company, so they&rsquo;ve got all these amazing artworks just around the walls all around the hallways of the headquarters building, so that was really cool and inspiring as a young college kid just walking around. They provided food. I was like, &ldquo;This is unreal. I cannot believe this is happening.&rdquo; And then they had a series of interviews throughout the day where you were interviewing with all sorts of different people. Then we left, and eventually I got a call back that I had gotten an internship there.</p>
<p>The way the internship worked was it started as a summer internship. They put us up in apartments - temporary apartments for the summer. We would live with some other interns, and that was great. I had a lot of fun living with the guys I lived with there who were also interning at Progressive.</p>
<p>I learned a ton. The position was another software programmer position, working on claims software for Progressive - the software that claims reps use there. So, while not the most inspiring product to work on, the people and the culture of the company and the technology we got to work with - all that was amazing, so I had a lot of fun and learned a ton there. Progressive was great too, like the place before, about providing training, giving me that time to really learn.</p>
<p>I think that is where my career really took off because that internship got extended into a further internship, or I think maybe it was a part-time job in my last semester of college. I really enjoyed it, and I really went all in on Progressive.</p>
<p>In college, I had that digital sciences major, but I also had a minor in Spanish. In high school, I had gone on a mission trip, a couple of mission trips actually, down to some Central American countries, and just fell in love with the culture and the language, so I was going for a Spanish minor. That last semester, man, it was loaded because I was trying to graduate a semester early. So I was really cramming things into my last semester. I had all my digital sciences stuff, which I had started on a year late because I started as a psych major. I had this Spanish minor that I had a few classes I had to take, and then I had that part-time job too.</p>
<p>I was just like, &ldquo;You know what? I cannot do this.&rdquo; So I ended up dropping the Spanish minor with only two classes left to go. It still hurts a little bit, but the decision, and I still stick by it, was just - I don&rsquo;t think I really need or needed that piece of paper. All the lessons about the culture and all the language practice - I learned those either way, and I don&rsquo;t know what I would have done with the actual minor anyways. So that was my decision at the time. I dropped the minor. I still speak Spanish a little bit. We get these bilingual books for our daughter, so I have a lot of fun getting to kind of speak Spanish to her and hopefully teach her some of that.</p>
<p>Progressive was great. I had that part-time job, which then went to their associate programmer, which was the lowest level, and then worked up to their mid-level programmer and was moving up really quick. I was learning a lot. I was taking on a lot of responsibility, doing a lot of extra things above my level. And I think that was seen, but also just working in a large company like that, there&rsquo;s a lot of processes and bureaucracy involved with moving up and rotating through promotions.</p>
<p>I had been talking with my manager for a while and was on track to get to their senior programmer level, but it just felt like it was taking a long time. They&rsquo;re like, &ldquo;Oh, we gotta give this other person this thing first, and we&rsquo;ve got you on the list. You&rsquo;re gonna get to that senior programmer position. I have your name on the list, but we just gotta wait till it&rsquo;s the right time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was frustrated with that, even though I loved the company. It just felt like I was progressing very quickly, and there just wasn&rsquo;t really room for me to grow or places for me to go. So I started looking for other jobs, and honestly, I wasn&rsquo;t looking very seriously. I had no intention of leaving Progressive, but I was feeling a little frustrated, and I just thought, &ldquo;You know what? Let me interview at some other companies for these more senior positions, just to see how it goes and learn what the interview process is like, get some practice with it again&rdquo; because I hadn&rsquo;t interviewed for a couple years at that point.</p>
<p>My criteria was, I would look for jobs that I would not think I would actually get an offer for. But if I did, I would consider taking it because I didn&rsquo;t want to just apply places where I knew if I got the offer, I&rsquo;d tell the place no, and screw a bunch of companies by doing that. So I thought, &ldquo;You know what? I&rsquo;ll just shoot for the stars. Go for places where I don&rsquo;t think that I&rsquo;d get the job, but get some practice interviewing there, and get some feedback about what I&rsquo;m missing, or what I could do better.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="nasa">NASA</h2>
<p>I applied to a few places. I think I got an offer at one that I turned down, and then I saw this NASA job come up, and this one I really, really did not think I was qualified for. I only applied because of the name on it was NASA. So I was like, &ldquo;Man, how cool would it be to go and work at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The job was very much a diagonal career move because it was a step up in seniority for sure from what I was doing at the time, and also a horizontal move, meaning it was very different work from what I was doing. My role at Progressive, I very much was a programmer day-to-day, writing code, building software applications directly, whereas this NASA job was more managing the work rather than doing the work. So it was a lot of oversight into the technical infrastructure of the team, helping the dev team with their processes, and how they&rsquo;re writing code. At that point, it was less product management, but doing a little bit of product management too - working with stakeholders, gathering requirements, and instead of just building the thing, figuring out what needed to be built and how we would build it instead of just taking orders and building whatever little piece I was told to do.</p>
<p>That was scary but interesting to me. So I went ahead and applied, and I genuinely did not think at all that I would get the offer. But I went through an initial interview, where they had some questions beforehand, I think about, &ldquo;Hey, you&rsquo;ve got these different projects with competing priorities. How would you handle it?&rdquo; or &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got this new application with these requirements. What kind of technology would you build it in? How would you architect it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I liked that they would take home questions because I got to really research. I mean, I spent a lot of time building out a system diagram for this hypothetical system that they asked me about. I think they liked the time that I spent on it. After the fact, after I got the job, they said, &ldquo;Yeah, I don&rsquo;t think anyone else spent that much time on it. Yours were for sure the most detailed answers,&rdquo; which I think just goes back to that persistence and energy that I had learned earlier in life.</p>
<p>I got called back for another interview, and even though I felt like the interviews and everything were going well, I was just like, &ldquo;Man, I don&rsquo;t know. All these people I&rsquo;m talking to with this job are a lot older than me. The people who would be my peers, a lot of people are 15, 20 years older than me,&rdquo; and I just thought for sure I was gonna get passed up, just due to inexperience, which I wouldn&rsquo;t have faulted them for at all.</p>
<p>But I got a call one day that I had gotten the job and was just floored and shocked by it, and really couldn&rsquo;t believe it. I remember getting onboarded. My manager at the time, Irene, I remember having a conversation with her before I really started, where she was like, &ldquo;You know, you are younger than a lot of people that work here.&rdquo; And I said, &ldquo;Oh yeah, yeah, I know, I figured, I&rsquo;m aware.&rdquo; And she said, &ldquo;Just feel like you&rsquo;ll handle that okay? If there&rsquo;s some folks who&hellip; there might be just a few folks who are not happy with that,&rdquo; just letting me know that there might be some challenges specifically related to that. And I said, &ldquo;You know what? No problem. I&rsquo;m game for it. I&rsquo;ll figure that out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But I do have to say that first year, maybe a year and a half, was a more difficult part of my career, because not necessarily with anyone I worked with directly or other civil servants on my team, but I did feel some of that of, like, &ldquo;Who is this kid coming in here and trying to tell us how to work, help us work better, telling us what to do,&rdquo; which I wasn&rsquo;t necessarily doing. But I was coming in and trying to change some things and make things better. So I think very much there was this perception of &ldquo;Who is this kid? Who let him in here?&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="growing-at-nasa">Growing at NASA</h2>
<p>I actually got a really good clear view of that. I went through this NASA leadership program, which was amazing. It was kind of a select group they picked from. I think a little over 300 people across the agency applied, and they picked 60. I made it in, and that was so cool because we got to travel to all these different centers and learn about the mission and hear from different NASA leadership.</p>
<p>The part of it I want to share is they did these different feedback assessments or surveys. One was called a 360 feedback assessment, where you were asking everyone around you to give you feedback. At the time that I applied to this leadership program, I&rsquo;d only been with the agency like a month or two. So by the time I was sending out the feedback assessment, I hadn&rsquo;t even been there a year yet. I was still pretty fresh, getting feedback from people around me, and I couldn&rsquo;t see who specifically, but I had it split up where I could see feedback from civil servants versus feedback from contractors.</p>
<p>From the contract side, I got some feedback that was pretty rough. I think some people might not have realized that the feedback goes directly to me. I think they might have thought that it goes to my supervisor because it was more worded towards a supervisor, like, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why we hired this guy because he doesn&rsquo;t seem like he has a lot of experience, and I have not worked with him enough to know to see if it&rsquo;s gonna work out, and I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s going to. And I think we should have hired someone else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Especially as someone who had that concern coming into the job, that was a day when I got that feedback where I just thought, &ldquo;Oh, that was rough to hear and to receive.&rdquo; That whole first year, it was a big transition. It felt like I had taken on a lot all in one bite. Despite it being difficult, I am proud of myself for having worked through that because I think now I&rsquo;m in a really good place where I&rsquo;ve built trust with my team and work well with them and really enjoy the work and enjoy the people too.</p>
<h2 id="where-i-am-now">Where I Am Now</h2>
<p>Especially the more product side - I&rsquo;m glad I made that jump. I do miss some of the programming and writing code, and I scratch that itch by doing some side projects that I work on. I miss writing code a little bit, but I really enjoy having that bigger picture, getting to make decisions myself. I think what it was before, while it&rsquo;s really rewarding to work on a little piece of code and then be done and see it work, it was more like, &ldquo;Hey, here&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re gonna build. Now, go build it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I like being on the other side and being able to implement with my team - not just being like, &ldquo;Hey, here&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re gonna go build, go build it.&rdquo; I mean, sometimes that&rsquo;s the case if it&rsquo;s just a really small, simple thing, but really bringing in my team - bringing in the design side and the developer side and us figuring out together the best way to build something. That has been really rewarding, to maybe make that work even better than ways I had seen before.</p>
<p>I love that big picture product strategy work. I&rsquo;ve gotten to do some zero-to-one work, like for the NASA Cause Analysis Tool that we built - that did not exist and was a new product we were building. That was a lot of fun to stand up from the ground up and talk with mishap investigators all across the agency and various other people and roles that do root cause analysis to understand, &ldquo;Hey, what do you guys really need? How do you work? What does it look like right now?&rdquo; I got to see all these different, crazy convoluted processes people do right now, and figure out what they need and turn that into a product they can really use.</p>
<p>We launched that back in March of last year, and we rolled it out iteratively. We rolled out a really small version of it and slowly built on it over time. But even with the limited set of functionality we&rsquo;ve released, people are using it and finding it useful and enjoying it.</p>
<h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping Up</h2>
<p>So that&rsquo;s a look at how I got where I am. I just arrived at work for the day and parked in my parking spot. So who knows, this might be the last car post I ever do, but I enjoyed it as a way to just stay busy during the commute. Usually, I&rsquo;m listening to a podcast or audiobook. I&rsquo;ve been on a history kick recently. I just finished &ldquo;1776&rdquo; by David McCullough and then just started &ldquo;John Adams,&rdquo; which is also by David McCullough, but that one has felt a little drier, which is why I think I wanted to do this car post today. I was like, &ldquo;You know what? I need to switch it up and do something different.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I think at the top of the article, I&rsquo;m going to try to put up a clip of the audio so you can listen to it if you want. The clip of the audio might end up being different to the text. I think what I&rsquo;m going to try to do is just use Google Recorder, the recorder app just on my phone to record this, and it makes a transcript live. I think I&rsquo;ll just post the audio clip, but I&rsquo;ll take the transcript, and I think I&rsquo;m just going to dump the whole thing into AI and be like, &ldquo;Hey, fix all the grammatical errors and maybe separate some of this, so it&rsquo;s not just one long blurb of me talking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the audio won&rsquo;t probably won&rsquo;t perfectly match the text, but I&rsquo;m curious to try that out and kind of see how it goes. If it feels like it&rsquo;s modifying my words too much, I&rsquo;ll just post the raw thing up there because I don&rsquo;t want it to be too different from what I&rsquo;ve been talking about.</p>
<p>Anyways, I&rsquo;m rambling at this point. It&rsquo;s been good talking into my phone for this car ride, and if you read this far, thank you, because this has been a long time of just talking.</p>

			 <p>A colleague asked me yesterday what routines and practices I&rsquo;ve been using to manage our new normal of working onsite every day. I typed up this response, and decided it was worth turning into a blog post so I could share it more broadly in case others were interested.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had all of three days to figure out this new routine, so it&rsquo;s ill-defined in its current iteration. I&rsquo;m sure it will get crisper over time, but here&rsquo;s what I have been doing the past few days.</p>
<h2 id="before-work">Before work</h2>
<ul>
<li>Prep everything the night before work. Meal, clothes, protein shake, etc. If I have to do it in the morning, it will be 10x worse.</li>
<li>Try to engage with a devotional each morning. For me, the value is reading something short but consequential, that helps me to see life is bigger than my work. And I like to engage with it by journaling about it, so that I&rsquo;m actually spending time with it and allowing it to reframe my mind.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="starting-work">Starting work</h2>
<ul>
<li>I use all of my willpower to not open my email first thing.</li>
<li>I look at my calendar and my todo list. I make new todos if I will need to prep for any of today&rsquo;s meeting.</li>
<li>I group my to-dos into either &ldquo;in-progress&rdquo; (should only be 1, maybe 2), &ldquo;next up&rdquo;, or &ldquo;backlog&rdquo;. When I do this, I try to be realistic about what I can actually accomplish today. Preferably, everything in &ldquo;Next Up&rdquo; can easily be done in a day, because it feels better to pull in more stuff from the backlog, rather than carrying over a bunch of todos to tomorrow.</li>
</ul>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2 id="during-work">During work</h2>
<ul>
<li>I have a single text file called &ldquo;Daily Log.md&rdquo; on my computer that I open up every day as my scratch pad. Each day gets an entry, and then anything can go in there. I usually just log what I am doing as I do it. Sometimes I will log something I learned, sometimes I take meeting notes in there. When I am not sure where something should go, I put it in this text file so I can triage it to where it belongs later.</li>
</ul>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<ul>
<li>I have another text file called &ldquo;Simmering.md&rdquo;. I use this as a record of all the things that aren&rsquo;t necessarily to-dos (they may be too big, or too undefined, or something else), but that I want to keep track of. A lot of these are &ldquo;side quests&rdquo; that I am working on, or want to work on at some point. Examples are: &ldquo;improve user guide process&rdquo;, &ldquo;april travel request&rdquo;, &ldquo;coordinate collaboration with GRC SMA&rdquo;.</li>
</ul>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2 id="ending-work">Ending work</h2>
<ul>
<li>I want to get better at this one.</li>
<li>Right now I just check over my to-do list about 30 minutes before I end my day, to make sure I haven&rsquo;t forgotten something critical that was due today.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ll glance at tomorrow&rsquo;s meetings so I know what&rsquo;s coming.</li>
<li>I will triage anything from my &ldquo;Daily Log.md&rdquo; that shouldn&rsquo;t live there long-term.</li>
<li>I look back over meetings from today, and decide if there are any last-minute notes/thoughts I need to capture or share, before they are lost to the ether of my ever-forgetful mind.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="after-work">After work</h2>
<ul>
<li>I do my best to leave work at work and be fully present for my family.</li>
<li>I use my commute home to decompress, which usually means listening to something not work related.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ll also start to transition to thinking about what needs done at home, or whether I need to do something restful and life-giving this evening.</li>
</ul>

			 <p>In my <a href="https://weidok.al/2025/01/20/weeknotes-vol.html">weeknotes post from January 20, 2025</a>, hours before the inauguration ceremony of Donald Trump, I wrote about being uncertain about what a Trump presidency would hold for me as a federal employee.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While government efficiency sounds good (who wouldn’t want that?), it seems like part of the plan is to make things tougher for federal employees. Including return to office mandates, layoffs, worse retirement/insurance benefits, and more. As a federal employee, that does not sound appealing. I am curious to see how much of it is talk, or frivolous bills that go nowhere in congress, and how much of it ends up becoming real and impacting my life.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But the speed and scale of change that I&rsquo;ve seen in the past month has far exceeded what I thought possible. That we have a president biased for action is indisputable. It&rsquo;s a stark contrast from the previous presidency. What&rsquo;s yet to be seen is the lasting effect this flurry of actions will have on our government, and therefore, our nation.</p>
<h2 id="disruptive-emails">Disruptive Emails</h2>
<p>Nine days after writing that post, two disruptive emails found their way into my inbox on the same day.</p>
<h3 id="return-to-in-person-work">Return to In-Person Work</h3>
<p>The less interesting of the two was an email from NASA HR with the subject &ldquo;<strong>Instructions for returning to in-person work</strong>&rdquo;. I knew this would come, but never expected it this quickly. All NASA employees, with few exceptions, will be back onsite full-time starting February 28. That includes me. In the past weeks I&rsquo;ve been involved in more than a few discussions about how we are going to make it work to come back onsite.</p>
<p>My organization, the NASA Safety Center, went all-in on the shift to hybrid work post-Covid. We sold about half of our office space. Almost everybody gave up their seat assignments, and the floor plan was reconfigured to optimize for &ldquo;hoteling&rdquo;. This allowed people to reserve a cubicle or pick from unoccupied desks in an open seating area. It worked great when we only needed to come in once a week. But now we are scrambling to reverse course.</p>
<p>We have <em>just</em> enough space to accommodate our 30+ civil servants. The team is scrambling to figure out who gets which seats, and coordinating everyone bringing in our NASA-provided IT equipment that we have been using at home for the past few years. On top of that, we don&rsquo;t have space for the contractor staff we work with closely on a day-to-day basis. We sold that space years ago and the team has grown since then. Contractors are not mandated to return to office under the executive order, so for now we are figuring out how to get all the civil servants back, and then we will figure out what to do with our contractors. We all have worked very effectively from home the past few years, so I believe (and hope) we will offer the contractors more leniency than we have received.</p>
<p>The intent behind the return to office is to get federal workers to quit (<a href="https://www.wsj.com/opinion/musk-and-ramaswamy-the-doge-plan-to-reform-government-supreme-court-guidance-end-executive-power-grab-fa51c020">Elon and Vivek said this publicly in an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal last year</a>), so I don&rsquo;t think that is the correct approach to take with our contractors unless we also want to them to quit. And we do not want that.</p>
<p>Beyond the professional complexities of bringing everyone back to the office, I am saddened about needing to make this change for my family. I will miss the ten hours a week I will lose with my family due to my commute. I&rsquo;ll certainly miss eating lunch with my wife and daughter, going on post-lunch walks, and being able to put my daughter down for her naps. I still feel incredibly fortunate for the job I have and a commute to the office doesn&rsquo;t change that, but this marks a stark change in routine and lifestyle, for myself and my family.</p>
<p>Not being one to wallow, I have been trying to focus on the silver linings. I&rsquo;ll get to connect with my coworkers more. I can become a voracious audiobook listener on my drives. My desk can be the home of a &ldquo;joke of the week&rdquo; board that becomes a small part of rebuilding office morale. Focusing on these potential positives has made it a little easier to accept that I&rsquo;ll be back in the office full-time soon.</p>
<p>This change came fast and heavy. While I&rsquo;m going to make the best of it, this is going to be a tough transition for my team and me. Yet despite the turmoil this has caused, the return to office email has taken up far less space in my conscience than the other email that graced my inbox on January 29.</p>
<h3 id="fork-in-the-road-deferred-resignation">Fork in the Road (Deferred Resignation)</h3>
<p>This other email came from a curious new sender that just said &ldquo;HR&rdquo; and had the subject &ldquo;Fork in the Road&rdquo;. It was marked as [EXTERNAL], which is an immediate red flag, and had no branding. If one was to craft the perfect spam email, this is the template they would follow.</p>
<p>But this was real.</p>
<p>This email came from <a href="mailto:hr@opm.gov">hr@opm.gov</a>. An email address that did not exist a week prior.</p>
<p>In the days leading up to this email, we had received two other emails from this address stating that the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) was testing a new government-wide email system. These messages were sent to all 2+ million federal employees.</p>
<p>But on February 29, we all got to see <em>why</em> this new email system had been set up. The Fork in the Road email introduced a program called Deferred Resignation. If you opted in to the program, you would agree to resign effective September 30, 2025. In return, you could work from home until your resignation date, and your agency <em>may</em> put you on administrative leave, effectively allowing you to receive your paycheck without working.</p>
<p>How would one enroll in this program, you ask? Respond to the email with the word RESIGN. That&rsquo;s it. Yes, seriously. No, I&rsquo;m not kidding.</p>
<p>If you want to see for yourself, <a href="https://garden.weidok.al/fork-in-the-road-email/">you can read the email here</a>. I saved my own copy in case OPM ever takes it down from their website, which they&rsquo;ve done with a couple of things over the past few weeks.</p>
<p>Now you might be wondering, &ldquo;Jake, did you take this!? Eight months of pay!? You could take a long vacation and find a new job!&rdquo;</p>
<p>No. I did not take this offer. I don&rsquo;t trust it.</p>
<p>There are a few reasons why I don&rsquo;t trust it. For starters, this email curiously has the same title as an email that Musk sent to Twitter employees when he took over there. What happened to Twitter employees who accepted the severance offer? <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/02/05/nx-s1-5286477/fork-in-the-road-twitter-federal-workers">They were not paid what they were promised</a>.  If that&rsquo;s not enough, it&rsquo;s also not clear that OPM/Trump/Musk have the authority to make this offer. The federal government is only funded through March 14. Congress needs to pass a new budget by then, and it&rsquo;s possible that they will not include appropriations for the people who took deferred resignation. And in addition to the budget, current federal law limits agencies to giving no more than 10 days of admin leave.</p>
<p>All of these are, in my opinion, good reasons to be skeptical of the offer.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s more.</p>
<p>A few days later, OPM sent a template Deferred Resignation agreement to agencies that had additional language about how the program would work. The language in the agreement is concerning. <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jYt1AtoWlG0yPBVoGZw4ttwerpNNCyFp/view?usp=drive_link">Here&rsquo;s a copy of the template agreement</a>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll point out a few of the most concerning clauses, emphasis mine.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Employee shall not be expected to work during the deferred resignation period except in rare circumstances as determined by [AGENCY].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what constitutes rare circumstances. We&rsquo;ve already seen some cases of employees still being required to work, such as IRS employees through tax return season. Another section reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By signing this agreement, the parties acknowledge that they have entered the agreement knowingly, voluntarily, and <strong>free from improper influence, coercion, or duress</strong>. Employee understands that, except as provided in paragraph 14 applicable to Employees 40 years of age or older, this agreement <strong>cannot be rescinded, except in the sole discretion of the [AGENCY HEAD], which shall not be subject to review at the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) or any other forum, and waives all rights to challenge the resignation before the MSPB or any other forum.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>First, I wouldn&rsquo;t say this offer is &ldquo;free from improper influence, coercion, or duress&rdquo;. The original fork email states that they intend to eliminate positions, and they cannot promise anyone who does not take this offer that they will still have a job. Further, this template agreement came out two days before the deadline to resign. A 48 hour timeframe might cause some duress for a big life decision like this.</p>
<p>But the second part I emphasized is much more concerning. In plain English, the Agency Head can undo this agreement whenever they want, and the employee gives up their right to do anything about it. In summary, this agreement binds the employee to its terms, but it does not bind the agency to its terms.</p>
<p>But wait! There&rsquo;s even more waiving of rights in here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Employee <strong>forever waives</strong>, and will not pursue through any judicial, administrative, or other process, <strong>any action against [AGENCY]</strong> that is based on, arising from, or related to Employee’s employment at [AGENCY] or the deferred resignation offer, including any and all claims that were or could have been brought concerning said matters. This waiver includes all claims Employee may have under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act. Employee <strong>unconditionally releases [AGENCY]</strong> and its present and former employees, officers, agents, representatives, and all persons acting by, through, or in concert with any of those individuals, either in their official or individual capacities, <strong>from any and all liability</strong> based on, arising from, or relating to the matters that Employee may have against them, including any and all claims that were or could have been brought. Consistent with applicable law, Employee similarly <strong>waives any claim that could be brought on Employee’s behalf by another entity, including Employee’s labor union.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wow. That clause is not typical in the other forms related to separating from the government. I wonder why they wanted to add that in for the Deferred Resignation? Perhaps they anticipate a decent amount of people taking legal action related to this program?</p>
<p>Hopefully you can understand why I chose not to take the Deferred Resignation.</p>
<p>Another funny twist in this story is that the day of the deadline, February 6, I got an urgent email from leadership that the deadline was midnight and there would be NO EXTENSIONS. Then an hour and a half later, I got an email that the deadline had been extended, because a judge put a temporary restraining order on the program until they could have a full hearing on it.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the case was thrown out because it had been brought by the federal labor unions, and the judge ruled that the unions did not have standing since they are not harmed by the offer.</p>
<p>Despite all the concerning points I highlighted above, NASA had about 800+ people on the list for deferred resignation. But here&rsquo;s the thing: when OPM compiled and sent the list to NASA, they accidentally included more than just the actual respondents. The count got inflated by supervisors who were cc&rsquo;d on emails, out-of-office replies to the &ldquo;Fork in the Road&rdquo; message, and others who had no plans to resign.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s worth noting that many who have taken the offer were already planning to retire or very near retirement. From what I&rsquo;m hearing, that seems to be the vast majority.</p>
<h2 id="further-shrinking-the-workforce">Further Shrinking the Workforce</h2>
<p>Beyond the Return to Office and the Deferred Resignation Program, there have been a few other attempts to downsize the federal workforce including eliminating DEI positions, firing probationary employees, and beginning preparations for a reduction in force (RIF).</p>
<h3 id="eliminating-dei">Eliminating DEI</h3>
<p>In compliance with the executive order &ldquo;<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/ending-radical-and-wasteful-government-dei-programs-and-preferencing/">Ending Radical And Wasteful Government DEI Programs And Preferencing</a>&rdquo;, NASA eliminated all functions and people whose primary focus was DEI. I think only a couple of people fit this description at NASA, but there&rsquo;s been a further effort to remove all language related to DEI from all employee performance plans.</p>
<h4 id="eliminating-gender">Eliminating Gender</h4>
<p>In addition to eliminating those positions and modifying performance plans, there were other changes mandated in a separate but related order titled &ldquo;<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/defending-women-from-gender-ideology-extremism-and-restoring-biological-truth-to-the-federal-government/">DEFENDING WOMEN FROM GENDER IDEOLOGY EXTREMISM AND RESTORING BIOLOGICAL TRUTH TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT</a>&rdquo;, such as replacing the word &ldquo;gender&rdquo; with &ldquo;sex&rdquo; in government forms and communications. I was tasked with making sure this change was made in one of our software applications that tracks mishaps. When someone is injured, we would collect their &ldquo;gender&rdquo; in the application, but had to change the name of that question to &ldquo;sex&rdquo;.</p>
<p>It was a trivial change to make. But it was strange to see everybody so nervous about getting it done by the deadline, all the way up to my boss&rsquo;s boss&rsquo;s boss. Even seemingly minor orders create intense pressure, with tight deadlines, unclear consequences for noncompliance, and widespread fear of job loss.</p>
<h3 id="firing-probationary-employees">Firing Probationary Employees</h3>
<p>When someone gets hired into the federal workforce, they start in a &ldquo;probationary&rdquo; period for the first year or two, depending on the position and agency. This is intended as a trial period, where the agency has more freedom to separate the employee within the probationary period if their performance does not meet the requirements of their position.</p>
<p>What we&rsquo;re seeing now is an unprecedented use of the probationary period. Probationary employees are being <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/saradorn/2025/02/21/heres-where-trumps-government-layoffs-are-fema-irs-tsa-and-more/">fired en masse at multiple federal agencies</a>. This is almost certainly illegal, because the intent is that probationary employees can be separated without severance or appeal <em><strong>for performance reasons</strong></em>. It will be interesting to see how this plays out in court, because many of those fired were given a generic reasoning of their termination being &ldquo;for performance reasons&rdquo; despite having stellar performance reviews and/or awards.</p>
<p>Luckily, NASA has been spared from these probationary firings for now. It was a dramatic week though, with rumors that firings would happen Tuesday, then <a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/02/nasa-receives-11th-hour-reprieve-from-probationary-employee-cuts/">rumors that it was paused by the White House</a>, then rumors that it would happen Friday, then nothing except <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/20/science/nasa-layoffs-workforce-firings/index.html#:~:text=NASA%20says%20job%20cuts%20for,Washington%2C%20DC%2C%20in%202023.">a statement from NASA that any probationary firings would be for performance reasons</a>.</p>
<h2 id="reduction-in-force">Reduction in Force</h2>
<p>One of the more recent executive orders is titled &ldquo;<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/implementing-the-presidents-department-of-government-efficiency-workforce-optimization-initiative/">Implementing The President’s “Department of Government Efficiency” Workforce Optimization</a>&rdquo;. This executive order calls for a reduction in force across the federal government. Some of the language in the order has caused a lot of concern, such as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Agency Heads shall promptly undertake preparations to initiate large-scale reductions in force (RIFs), consistent with applicable law, and <em><strong>to separate from Federal service temporary employees</strong></em> and reemployed annuitants working in areas that will likely be subject to the RIFs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was hired in as a temporary employee, but luckily was converted to permanent last year. But I work with a few temporary employees who fear for their jobs based on the way this is worded. If this is carried out as-worded, it would impact a large chunk of NASA&rsquo;s workforce. Here&rsquo;s another concerning section:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All offices that perform functions not mandated by statute or other law shall be prioritized in the RIFs, including all agency diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives; all agency initiatives, components, or operations that my Administration suspends or closes; and <em><strong>all components and employees performing functions not mandated by statute or other law who are not typically designated as essential during a lapse in appropriations</strong></em> as provided in the Agency Contingency Plans on the Office of Management and Budget website.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand how all employees not designated as essential during a lapse in appropriations should be prioritized in RIFs. At NASA, that&rsquo;s more than 90% of the workforce. When the government shuts down, it&rsquo;s pretty much just security and facility/IT maintenance who still come in to make sure things don&rsquo;t break or get stolen. I can&rsquo;t imagine this actually being implemented as it is worded, but the wording is causing a lot of confusion and frustration at NASA.</p>
<p>So far, the reduction hasn&rsquo;t actually begun, but agencies are planning for it. This will take time, but I have no idea what the breadth or scope of the reductions in force will be. I could lose my job from this, but there is no way to tell for sure right now. It helps that I was converted to a permanent position last year, but it doesn&rsquo;t help that I only have 3 years of federal service and do not have a veteran status.</p>
<h2 id="the-latest-elon-email">The Latest Elon Email</h2>
<p>Yesterday, Saturday, February 22, all federal employees received an email titled &ldquo;What did you do last week?&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The email reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Please reply to this email with approx. 5 bullets of what you accomplished last week and cc your manager.</p>
<p>Please do not send any classified information, links, or attachments.</p>
<p>Deadline is this Monday at 11:59pmEST.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Viewed in isolation, that&rsquo;s weird, but not terrible. What makes it much more malicious is this tweet from Elon <strong>before this email was sent:</strong>*</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I don&rsquo;t see any way it would be legal for a non-response to be equivalent to an employee submitting their resignation. It&rsquo;s hard to believe these are official government communications being sent to 2+ million federal workers.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s further frustrating is that OPM doesn&rsquo;t have the authority to ask for something like this.</p>
<p>I plan not to respond unless I receive a direct order from NASA to respond.</p>
<p>The invisible subtext behind this email is offensive. It seems to say &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t believe you accomplished much of anything last week. Justify yourself to us, or resign.&rdquo; At the very least, this administration is clearly flexing its muscles and attempting to force federal workers to comply with its untraditional demands.</p>
<p>While I hesitate to make such a strong analogy, I can&rsquo;t help but be reminded of the stories of German policemen in &ldquo;Ordinary Men&rdquo;. They ended up committing atrocities they could never imagine, but were led to that place slowly by continually complying to small, seemingly innocuous orders. I can&rsquo;t help but wonder if these little orders are meant to condition me into a similar place of compliance and submission. The thought of that repulses me, but it is in the back of my mind with each new directive that comes out.</p>
<h2 id="whats-next">What&rsquo;s Next?</h2>
<p>Nobody knows for certain what comes next, but it seems pretty clear that it won&rsquo;t be anything good, at least from the perspective of a federal employee. We know we have the reduction in force to look forward to. I&rsquo;m certain we&rsquo;ll get some more Elon-inspired emails sent to the whole government. NASA has a DOGE rep installed at headquarters now, but I&rsquo;m not sure exactly what they&rsquo;ll be doing. The word is that they&rsquo;re looking for contracts to cut. And the &ldquo;Fork in the Road&rdquo; email hinted that the performance ratings process will become more rigorous.</p>
<p>On March 14 government funding expires. I am not sure whether to expect a government shutdown or congress to pass a budget. If they do pass a budget, I suspect there will be new legislation included that will adversely affect federal employees. <a href="https://www.afge.org/article/124-billion-in-federal-benefits-on-house-republicans-chopping-block/">Recent proposed legislation has suggested cuts to federal employee benefits</a>.</p>
<p>Beyond that, who knows. In the meantime, I will be getting my work done and doing my best to ignore all the noise this is causing. I hope to be a calming presence for my coworkers in the midst of all the chaos and fear. As a Christian, this is a good opportunity for me to &ldquo;love my neighbors&rdquo;, especially as so much animosity is being directed at them.</p>
<p>I also plan to keep this post updated at the bottom with any new things that happen, mostly as a reference for myself so I can look back someday and remember how wild things were as a fed back in 2025.</p>

			 <p>My week summarized into 3 highlights, 2 discoveries, and 1 anticipation.</p>
<h2 id="3-highlights">3 Highlights</h2>
<p><strong>The Office</strong> - I went into the office on Tuesday this week, which was a highlight for two reasons. First, I got an InBody scan as part of a twelve-week fitness challenge I am doing through NASA. The results were what I expected, and I have some work to do to get my body composition to where I want it! Second, my team celebrated the past year by going to <a href="https://topgolf.com/us/">Topgolf</a>! It was great being able to chat with coworkers without work being the main topic, and golfing in whiteout conditions was beautiful! Although driving home afterward was a little scary.</p>
<p><strong>The Basement</strong> - We finally got the last quote on our basement, and it was our best yet. It&rsquo;s beginning to feel a lot more real and my wife and I have been spending all week deciding on various finishes for the basement.</p>
<p><strong>The Barn</strong> - We met up with my parents and grandparents for lunch at a local place serving up &ldquo;country cooking&rdquo;. The best part was getting to see my grandparents and talk with them, but the all-you-can-eat soup, salad, and bread bar was pretty good too.</p>
<h2 id="2-discoveries">2 Discoveries</h2>
<p><strong><a href="https://developer.chrome.com/blog/inside-browser-part1">Inside look at modern web browser (part 1)</a></strong> - This four part blog series from Google is a really neat deep-dive into how browsers work, with lots of fun illustrations to help with the concepts. I haven&rsquo;t made it through all four parts yet, but I&rsquo;ve already learned from it. I shared this with my team at work this week since we work on web apps that run in-browser and while knowing browsers at this level detail isn&rsquo;t always <em>necessary</em> day-to-day, it can come in handy. And helps build an appreciation for what is really happening in between raw code and interactive website.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v46/n17/john-lanchester/for-every-winner-a-loser">For Every Winner a Loser</a></strong> - This was a fascinating article on how modern finance works. The gist is that most finance is not actually about trading or lending money for goods and services, it&rsquo;s about betting on prices moving up or down. This paragraph blew my mind&hellip;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The total value of all the economic activity in the world is estimated at $105 trillion. That’s the mangoes. The value of the financial derivatives which arise from this activity – that’s the subsequent trading – is $667 trillion. That makes it the biggest business in the world. And in terms of the things it produces, that business is useless. It does nothing and adds no value. It is just one speculator betting against another and for every winner, on every single transaction, there is an exactly equivalent loser.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="1-anticipation">1 Anticipation</h2>
<p><strong>A new president</strong> - I tend to be pretty apolitical, but I have been paying close attention the upcoming administration change. That is neither an endorsement nor an indictment, but this is my first administration change as a federal employee, so this has a much more direct impact on my life than I have felt before. And beyond just the change of party, this particular president seems to have a focus on government efficiency. While government efficiency sounds good (who wouldn&rsquo;t want that?), it seems like part of the plan is to make things tougher for federal employees. Including return to office mandates, layoffs, worse retirement/insurance benefits, and more. As a federal employee, that does not sound appealing. I am curious to see how much of it is talk, or frivolous bills that go nowhere in congress, and how much of it ends up becoming real and impacting my life.</p>

			 <p>My week summarized into 3 highlights, 2 discoveries, and 1 anticipation.</p>
<h2 id="3-highlights">3 Highlights</h2>
<p><strong>Eating in</strong><br>
My wife and I have a chronic problem with being unprepared when dinner time rolls around, so we often end up ordering food or going out. My belt and my bank statements would attest that this is not a good practice. But this week we did much better eating in for most of our meals. <del>I found the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.buzzfeed.tasty&amp;hl=en_US&amp;pli=1">Tasty app</a> and have been using that to plan our meals each Saturday so we can pick up groceries on Sunday.</del> Since writing this, I&rsquo;ve switched over to the <a href="https://www.paprikaapp.com/">Paprika</a> app so I can get recipes from more sources (I&rsquo;ve enjoyed <a href="https://www.budgetbytes.com/">Budget Bytes</a>, but I am taking recommendations). I like that the interface is bare-bones, with no fluffy advertising or bright pictures/text. Cooking and eating together has been a delightful time for our family. My daughter has been using the <a href="https://a.co/d/dPsv20c">toddler tower</a> that my parents got her for Christmas to help while cooking. She likes taste-testing ingredients as we cook and watching hot pans on the stove from a distance.</p>
<p><strong>Helping Hands</strong><br>
I didn&rsquo;t have to work on Thursday since federal agencies were closed in remembrance of President Jimmy Carter. Instead, I spent the whole day working on the house with my wife, while each of our moms came over at different times to help watch our daughter. It&rsquo;s amazing how much can get done on a free day with minimal child watching responsibilities. And it was fantastic getting to see and talk with each of our moms.</p>
<p><strong>Green Owl</strong><br>
This week I got back on <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/">DuoLingo</a> to try to revive my Spanish skills. I nearly minored in Spanish in college. I dropped my minor during my last semester, with only two classes left, so that I could focus on my internship. It feels a bit tragic to have been so close and not made it across the finish line, but I would make the same decision again. Since then, I&rsquo;ve been noticing my Spanish comprehension slowly slipping away year by year. I&rsquo;ve been having a lot of fun this week dusting off the cobwebs and experiencing &ldquo;Aha!&rdquo; moments as the intricacies of the Spanish language slowly come back to me. Also, I&rsquo;ve noticed DuoLingo has changed a lot since I last used it a couple of years ago. I read an article about how they are big on &ldquo;gamification&rdquo;, but it&rsquo;s crazy all the tricks they use to make it fun (and addicting) to learn a language. I guess dopamine reward circuit hijacking is okay if it&rsquo;s for a good purpose?</p>
<h2 id="2-discoveries">2 Discoveries</h2>
<p><strong>AI App-Building Platforms</strong><br>
I&rsquo;ve known about these AI coding platforms for a while, but just started playing with them this week and I can&rsquo;t believe how <em>good</em> they are! The main one I&rsquo;ve been messing around with is <a href="https://lovable.dev">lovable.dev</a>. You just give it a prompt, and it will build an app for you in seconds. Then you can tweak the app with more prompts. Once it&rsquo;s ready, you can hook up a database with <a href="https://supabase.com/">Supabase</a> and deploy with <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> or <a href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a>. Gone are the days of people saying with a straight face, &ldquo;I have SUCH GOOD app ideas! I would be a millionaire if only I knew how to build them!&rdquo;. There are no excuses for not building now.

<p><strong>Wesley Huff</strong><br>
<a href="https://www.wesleyhuff.com/bio">Wesley Huff</a> is a biblical scholar with a <a href="https://www.wesleyhuff.com/">personal website packed with resources on biblical history.</a> I came across him this week on a podcast. His knowledge on original source documents for scripture is impressive. I can tell that he is very well studied from listening to him, and his website has a lot of great <a href="https://www.wesleyhuff.com/infographics">infographics</a> that he has made himself on the bible, manuscripts, archaeology, translation, and more.</p>
<h2 id="1-anticipation">1 Anticipation</h2>
<p><strong>Fitness Challenge</strong><br>
I signed up for a twelve-week fitness challenge through NASA. The main reason I signed up is that I will receive three free body composition reports via calipers and <a href="https://inbodyusa.com/general/inbody-test/">InBody tests</a>, each spaced six weeks apart. I just started intermittent fasting and regular exercise a couple of weeks ago, so I&rsquo;m excited to use these reports as extra motivation to stick with it and see how my body composition changes over the next twelve weeks. I&rsquo;ve already lost 5 pounds in the last week, if my scale can be trusted! I&rsquo;ll have my first test on Tuesday.</p>

My coworker is using it to plan group travel for his new team at NASA. It&rsquo;s nice to see it still getting some use, and it may be getting more use in the near future!</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m on the couch, coffee in hand, excited to try a new format.</p>
<p>I actually have no idea what the true <em>format</em> will be, but I know that I am going to write weekly. The plan is to have a consistent format for these weeknotes, but I&rsquo;m more concerned with actually doing the thing, so I&rsquo;m starting without the format. Jump first, find a parachute later, right?</p>
<p>Bear with me while I sort things out for the first 5, 10, or 50 of these.</p>
<p>The holiday marathon has come to an end, and it feels like I&rsquo;m settling in for winter now that snow has fallen and stayed for more than 24 hours.</p>
<h2 id="basement">Basement</h2>
<p>Being stuck inside, my attention has turned toward my house and projects that need to be done. The biggest of these is finishing the basement. My wife and I have been getting quotes, with the last of these being last week. We also took a trip to the three major big box stores near us, and must have taken at least $100 worth of samples.</p>
<p>I have completely lost my kitchen island to paint and flooring samples. It looks like a detective is trying to solve a murder, and the primary suspects are green-ish paint, blue-ish paint, and vinyl plank.</p>
<h2 id="1zpresso">1Zpresso</h2>
<p>I bought a really nice manual coffee grinder this week, the <a href="https://1zpresso.coffee/product/j/">1Zpresso J</a>. I thought about it for 7 days and 7 nights, and then decided to go for it.</p>
<p>It feels outrageously-priced for something where I still need to grind my own coffee, but I convinced myself it was worth it after reading endless forum discussions on coffee grinders. Supposedly the machining is incredibly precise and there were people who had been using theirs for 10+ years.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited to feel more connected with my coffee. I&rsquo;m looking forward to the morning ritual of grinding my own beans fresh, and then making a pour over in my <a href="https://chemexcoffeemaker.com/products/six-cup-classic-chemex">Chemex</a>. I&rsquo;m also dreaming of sharing this experience with people who haven&rsquo;t had high quality coffee before. Coffee can be such a wonderfully communal experience.</p>
<p>Anyways, that&rsquo;s probably just all the feel-good stuff I told myself to justify the purchase. It worked.</p>
<h2 id="work">Work</h2>
<p>I went into the office on Thursday and it was pretty quiet. I talked with our IT guy and got to meet the new designer who just joined on the contract.</p>
<p>I had a lot of time off and most people are out of the office, but our team is also all hands on deck for a major release to the NASA Mishap Information System on Jan 12. So it&rsquo;s been one of those quiet-but-busy type of weeks.</p>
<h2 id="health">Health</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been back on intermittent fasting, which has been going well so far. I&rsquo;m trying to only eat between 12-8, but shorter is better. I&rsquo;ve always found that to be the easiest eating pattern for me to follow. I started before the Holiday stretch, which was a bad idea, but things have leveled out now.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also started working out this week (classic New Year). My wife and I have been following along to work out videos on YouTube from our living room each evening, and then stretching afterward. We found a guy that makes videos of Tabata workouts from scenic locations and doesn&rsquo;t do any talking. That was perfect for us.</p>
<p>In addition to our evening workouts we do together, I&rsquo;ve been working out in the mornings. We got <a href="https://www.bowflex.com/product/max-trainer-m6-elliptical/100755.html?adID=DOFG2BFEED1&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiA-Oi7BhA1EiwA2rIu2wMmvpbCby4XFf0dz_TjSoBSkZJMHvR_Uluql7riCQrXj3nRcAgrcBoChyAQAvD_BwE">this treadmill/stair stepper</a> <em>way</em> on sale on Facebook Marketplace recently, so some mornings I use that, or I&rsquo;ve been using the resistance bands I got for Christmas.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure that I would have ever bought resistance bands for myself, but I&rsquo;m really excited for them now that I have them. They&rsquo;re easy to use, and I can do all sorts of different things with them. I&rsquo;m keeping them in my office near my standing desk so that I can get some exercise while I&rsquo;m in meetings for work.</p>
<h2 id="devotional">Devotional</h2>
<p>My wife got me the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Grace-Moment-Note-Taking-Leathersoft-Inspirational/dp/1400236339/ref=asc_df_1400236339?mcid=9d6f4455af77396399ec08b46a615cf0&amp;hvocijid=7501333102641938068-1400236339-&amp;hvexpln=73&amp;tag=hyprod-20&amp;linkCode=df0&amp;hvadid=721245378154&amp;hvpos=&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=7501333102641938068&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=9015351&amp;hvtargid=pla-2281435182378&amp;psc=1">Grace for the Moment</a> devotional for Christmas, and I have used it every day since. Each page is super short, but leaves some space for writing in your own thoughts/reactions. I like being able to slow down with something really short and process through how I feel about it.</p>
<p>This is the first thing I do in the morning (well&hellip; after I get my coffee) and it has felt right to prioritize the first part of my morning to look up to God.</p>
<h2 id="analog">Analog</h2>
<p>I can feel myself moving into an analog renaissance (again). What I mean by that is I&rsquo;m using a lot less digital tools and a lot more physical tools in my day to day.</p>
<p>I have been using my bullet journal to capture daily to-dos and track things on a monthly cadence, including my intermittent fasting. I also <a href="https://weidok.al/2025/01/03/my-latest-attempt-to-be.html">started printing off articles on pieces of paper to carry with me</a> so I don&rsquo;t pull out my phone as much. And I&rsquo;m moving toward taking my sermon notes in a journal instead of digitally, although it has been super cool to see all of my sermon notes and share them from <a href="https://garden.weidok.al/notes/110-sermons/">my digital garden</a>. I&rsquo;m having fun taking notes more visually, drawing ideas/concepts that really resonate with me.</p>
<h2 id="weeknotes-vol-1-postmortem">Weeknotes Vol. 1 Postmortem</h2>
<p>It felt nice to reflect on my week, but this is definitely not the final format.</p>
<p>I want to keep these weeknotes shorter and punchier. I&rsquo;ll be more likely to keep up with it that way. I like how Tim Ferris does his <a href="https://newsletterhunt.com/emails/5878">5 Bullet Friday</a>, so it may end up similar to that.</p>
<p>But I did it. I&rsquo;ll take my win, and I&rsquo;ll see you next week.</p>

<p>My first full year of blogging is in the books! Or should I say, in the <a href="https://archive.org/">internet archive</a>? Check out this neat <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/sitemap/weidok.al">sitemap graph of my blog</a> generated by the internet archive.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;ve been doing this for over a year!</p>
<p>One thing that has become clear is I write more like a geyser than a waterfall. I spend most of my time dormant, and then have a sudden flurry of activity before going quiet again. In the new year I would like to move a little more toward the waterfall model: steady, consistent, and reliable. But, I also would like to have more grace for my geyser-like tendencies. The geyser is beautiful in its own way.</p>
<h2 id="articles">Articles</h2>
<p>This year I wrote 34 <a href="https://weidok.al/">articles</a>. Well, 35 if you include this one.</p>
<p>My unspoken goal before the year was one article a week, but I&rsquo;m happy with where I landed. I liked not feeling pressured and being able to write when inspiration struck. That said, I&rsquo;ve been toying with the idea of committing to writing something on a weekly cadence. I&rsquo;ve thought about starting a separate newsletter, but that&rsquo;s more than I want to take on right now. Instead, I&rsquo;m thinking about doing a weekly review post on this blog instead. That will force me to reflect on my life more regularly, and will keep my 8 email subscribers up-to-date with my weekly happenings.</p>
<p>Here are some stats on those 34 articles:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Most popular</strong>: <a href="https://weidok.al/2024/02/15/i-use-my.html">My Obsidian Daily Note Template</a> - this is consistently my most-viewed article. It was my first article of the year, and is a technical deep dive into how I set up my daily notes in my note-taking app. I still get an email roughly monthly from someone asking me further questions about how I set things up in Obsidian. Actually, as I was writing this, someone reached out from the article and asked me if I have implemented &ldquo;heat map habit tracking&rdquo; in Obsidian (I have not). This article had 243 views in the last 90 days. For reference, the next most viewed article over that span had 17 views.</li>
<li><strong>Most words</strong>: <a href="https://weidok.al/2024/02/15/i-use-my.html">My Obsidian Daily Note Template</a> - ~3500 words. The runner-up is my <a href="https://weidok.al/2024/11/28/capturing-shower-thoughts.html">recent post on Aqua Notes</a> at ~1800 words.</li>
<li><strong>Least words</strong>: <a href="https://weidok.al/2024/09/29/this-started-with.html">This Started With A Title</a> - 23 words</li>
<li><strong>Personal Favorite</strong>: <a href="https://weidok.al/2024/09/13/street-corner.html">Street Corner</a> - Although my technical explainer posts seem to get more views, I love writing personal reflections. This one felt really raw. I remember experiencing the moment I describe in the article, and then feeling later that day like I just <em>had</em> to write about it.</li>
<li><strong>Average time spent writing each article</strong>: No idea. I don&rsquo;t track this. But it&rsquo;s pretty short I think. Maybe an hour or two? I don&rsquo;t usually spend multiple days with a lot of editing and researching and refining. I write it and send it.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="microblogs">Microblogs</h2>
<p>I also posted 132 <a href="https://weidok.al/micro/">microblogs</a> this year. A large chunk of those were in January, because I went through the book of Proverbs and did a post for each one trying to summarize the most salient points in my own words. This was my way of &ldquo;<a href="https://weidok.al/2024/01/01/to-start-my.html">starting my year with wisdom</a>&rdquo; and was also meant to get me into the habit of regularly posting to my blog, no matter how uncomfortable it felt at the time.</p>
<h2 id="traffic">Traffic</h2>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t start tracking analytics until later in the year, but since September 432 people have visited my blog.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>About 62 of those users came back to my site at least once, and on average people spend 1 minute and 9 seconds on the blog.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The blog was a global sensation (hyperbole) with visitors from every continent other than Antarctica (shout out to the one visitor from Egypt representing all of Africa).</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>People came to my blog from various corners of the interwebs. Direct traffic, LinkedIn, Google, Reddit, and my newsletter service were all big drivers.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Most people visiting my blog were probably using Chrome on a Windows machine.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>So, what is my takeaway from all of these analytics? Not much. It&rsquo;s fun to look at during the end of the year, but there&rsquo;s nothing actionable for me here. I&rsquo;m not trying to supercharge my blog&rsquo;s growth. I just want to write meaningful and helpful words.</p>
<h2 id="design">Design</h2>
<p>I made various changes to the look and feel of my blog throughout the year. You can see all the changes I made since June 10, 2024 in my <a href="https://weidok.al/changelog/">changelog</a>. It looks <em>very</em> different from where it originally started, which I shared screenshots of in <a href="https://weidok.al/2024/02/24/tear-it-all.html">Tear it All Down</a>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m following the KISS design principle: &ldquo;Keep It Simple Stupid&rdquo;.</p>
<h2 id="what-will-2025-hold">What will 2025 hold?</h2>
<p>Your guess is as good as mine. Will I become an author? Will I abandon my blog and run off with my pen and analog journal? Will artificial intelligence and quantum computing and brain chip implants converge to make the written word irrelevant as we all mind meld and communicate wordlessly and instantly? All possibilities.</p>
<p>As far as my blog goes, 2025 will be similar to 2024. I want to write more, and I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll make design tweaks to my blog here and there. But otherwise I&rsquo;ll continue to write things that I think are meaningful and/or helpful.</p>
<p>As far as my life goes, it looks like change is a brewin'. I&rsquo;m looking forward to the new year and all that it has to offer. Some things are scary, some are exciting, all will make for good writing material.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wait to share my perspective in the new year with you. Thanks for sticking around through my self-indulgent &ldquo;blog in review&rdquo; post.</p>
<p>I wish you a happy new year and hope your year is filled with love, given and received.</p>

			 <p>I learned it&rsquo;s weird to talk to your coworkers about your showering habits.</p>
<p>The slightly uncomfortable laughs gave it away.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s been on my mind because I&rsquo;ve been doing something different in the shower lately. I think showers are more than just a way to get clean. They&rsquo;re also a space to think. While most people have &ldquo;shower thoughts&rdquo;, I bet a majority can&rsquo;t remember them.</p>
<p>When I say that showers are a &ldquo;space to think&rdquo;, I don&rsquo;t just mean they&rsquo;re a place to have thoughts pop in and out. I mean they are a place to do real thinking. To me, real thinking involves:</p>
<ol>
<li>Loading up your <strong>short-term memory</strong> to work through a web of thought.</li>
<li>Moving the important bits over to <strong>long-term memory</strong> for future use.</li>
</ol>
<p>Unfortunately, my brain is terrible at real thinking. It may be an inborn trait, or it may be a symptom of growing up a digital native. My brain feels like it&rsquo;s wired for <em>reacting</em>: social media, texting, news cycles, etc. But I struggle to just&hellip; think.</p>
<p>Except I have a little trick to help me do real thinking: <em>writing things down</em>. The paper is part memory-aid and part memory-replacement. Seeing the words in writing helps encode them in my brain, but it also provides a hard-copy of the thought in case my brain fails to hold onto it. Yet even more helpful is using the paper as my short-term memory. I can follow a long chain of thought and remember every step I took. When my thoughts are trapped in paper, they are outside of me, so it is easier to separate my thoughts from my self. I can observe them with more objectivity.</p>
<p>So showers are a space for thinking, but real thinking requires writing. Therefore, showers are a space for writing.</p>
<p>But <em>how</em> does one write in the shower?</p>
<p>I use <a href="https://www.myaquanotes.com/">Aqua Notes</a>.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><em>This is not a paid post and there are no affiliate links. I just like Aqua Notes.</em></p>
<h2 id="aqua-notes-has-changed-the-way-i-shower">Aqua Notes has changed the way I shower</h2>
<p>Some days I go into my shower with an idea I really need to think through: a complex challenge at work, a parenting dilemma, a tough conversation I need to have, etc. But on other days, I sleepily clamber into the shower and wait to see what rises to the surface of my mind while the warm water hits my back.</p>
<p>Regardless which kind of day I&rsquo;m having, having a paper pad in the shower gives me a way to externalize my inner dialog.</p>
<p>Whether I&rsquo;m showering with the intention of thinking or not, I always end up doing some thinking. The shower seems to have a unique capacity for shining a light on the recesses of my mind. Then the paper can capture the fleeting ideas that usually lie dormant in these recesses.</p>
<p>I have used Aqua notes to capture all sorts of shower thoughts, from random ideas, to poetry, to visuals. I want to tell you more about what Aqua Notes is, how I&rsquo;ve used it, and other things I tried before Aqua Notes.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-aqua-notes">What is Aqua Notes?</h2>
<p>Aqua Notes is a simple product. It is just a plasticky paper notepad, a pencil, and suction cups. It was founded by a guy that wanted to remember his shower thoughts, and all the component pieces are manufactured and assembled in the USA.</p>
<h3 id="the-pad">The Pad</h3>
<p>The paper in the pad is waterproof and has a very smooth texture. It is surprisingly easy to write on with pencil, even when wet!</p>
<p>I have not seen this advertised or discussed anywhere, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that each piece of paper can be ripped off and stuck to the wall by itself. It just takes a little water, and I&rsquo;ve never had a piece of paper fall off the wall from drying out. This lets me write on the reverse side of each paper and fill up my shower wall with notes like a mad scientist.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Being able to rip off pieces of paper also means that I can take my notes with me outside the shower if I need to.</p>
<p>The paper is a little difficult to rip cleanly (although it is perforated) so you have to be careful when pulling a page off the pad.</p>
<h3 id="the-pencil">The Pencil</h3>
<p>The pencil is a standard graphite pencil that needs to be sharpened occasionally. Inscribed on one side is the saying &ldquo;NO MORE GREAT IDEAS DOWN THE DRAIN!&rdquo;. It has an eraser, which works okay on the plasticky paper. It&rsquo;s not as easy to erase as standard paper, but not too difficult either.</p>
<p>The pencil has been great, and I love that it&rsquo;s a no-nonsense tool I can always expect to work. Unlike some of the <a href="#alternatives-ive-tried-for-capturing-shower-thoughts">other things I&rsquo;ve tried</a>&hellip;</p>
<h3 id="the-suction-cups">The Suction Cups</h3>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have much to say here other than that I have had no issues with these staying on the wall. That was something I was concerned about when I bought this, so I wanted to mention it for others wondering the same.</p>
<p>Now that you know what Aqua Notes is, you might be thinking &ldquo;but what would I actually write on there?&rdquo; The answer is: all sorts of things!</p>
<h2 id="what-i-write-in-the-shower">What I write in the shower</h2>
<h3 id="tasks">Tasks</h3>
<p>I used to think of something I needed to do while showering, and then would forget it right after.</p>
<p>Now I can write down any pesky to-dos that come up during my shower. After I shower, I&rsquo;ll take a look at my notes and transfer any tasks into my phone or elsewhere.</p>
<h3 id="random-thoughts">Random thoughts</h3>
<p>Some random thoughts are worth capturing. This could be a spontaneous idea for a product, self-reflection about how I am living my life, or anything in between.</p>
<h3 id="intentional-thoughts">Intentional thoughts</h3>
<p>Occasionally I&rsquo;ll give my shower a goal. In these cases there&rsquo;s a very specific thing I need to think through, so I will use my shower as a chunk of dedicated time to work through it. I write through each step of the process and work out my thoughts methodically.</p>
<h3 id="podcast-notes">Podcast notes</h3>
<p>Sometimes I listen to a podcast while I&rsquo;m in the shower, so I will write down any memorable quotes. I also write down my own notes about impactful ideas I want to remember.</p>
<h3 id="visuals">Visuals</h3>
<p>Many thoughts are better captured in a visual rather than words. I might be trying to work through a complex topic, or there might just be an image in my brain that I want to hold onto for later.</p>
<p>I love that the empty pad gives my notes the flexibility to take whatever form they need.</p>
<h3 id="haiku">Haiku</h3>
<p>I enjoy writing haiku occasionally. I use it as a way to capture an idea in short, memorable prose.</p>
<h3 id="love-notes-for-my-wife">Love notes for my wife</h3>
<p>Short shower notes are a sweet, thoughtful surprise that I use to lift up my wife.</p>
<h2 id="alternatives-ive-tried-for-capturing-shower-thoughts">Alternatives I&rsquo;ve tried for capturing shower thoughts</h2>
<p>Before Aqua Notes, I had tried to perfect the art of capturing shower thoughts. My previous attempts had revolved around using technology, but they all fell short. I had assumed digital capture would be better because it would be quicker and easier to retrieve my notes. But I found all the digital options to be unreliable and have come to appreciate the way that the slowness of handwriting allows me to simmer in my thoughts.</p>
<h3 id="smartwatch">Smartwatch</h3>
<p>I thought for sure the smartwatch would be the answer. I could dictate my notes into my watch and then have them seamlessly uploaded to the cloud for safekeeping and retrieval later. But this didn&rsquo;t play out in reality the same way that I dreamt it up.</p>
<p>For one, dictation into my watch (Galaxy Watch 5) sucked. It was bad outside the shower, but inside the shower with all the noise I could rarely get it to capture a single sentence correctly.</p>
<p>I also ran into an issue with the apps I tried to use to capture notes. I tried Google Keep and the recording app that came on the watch. The recording app would just randomly shut off in the middle of me talking, which was irritating. And I think something similar happened with Google Keep, although I can&rsquo;t quite remember.</p>
<p>And don&rsquo;t even get me started on interacting with the watch screen while it was wet.</p>
<p>Maybe an Apple Watch could do better, but my Galaxy Watch was NOT a good shower notes companion.</p>
<h3 id="alexa">Alexa</h3>
<p>I also tried setting an Amazon Echo Dot right outside the shower so I could shout notes to it, but it did a poor job capturing what I said as well. It was also pretty annoying to try shouting outside the shower, or opening the door and poking my head out each time I had a thought.</p>
<h3 id="phone">Phone</h3>
<p>When I got frustrated with my watch, I tried using my phone for a little while, but that was destined for failure because I was too scared to get it near the water. It was hard to interact with if my hands were wet, and voice commands didn&rsquo;t work out too well for me.</p>
<p>After going through all of these iterations of digital tools, I realized that sometimes the simplest tools are the most powerful.</p>
<h2 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2>
<p><strong>Writing</strong> is great for <strong>thinking</strong> is great for <strong>showering</strong>. So writing is great for showering.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been amazed at the insights I&rsquo;ve captured while in the shower. It brings me joy to see an idea from a shower months ago that sparks new thought patterns in me today.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.myaquanotes.com/">Aqua Notes</a> is the best tool I&rsquo;ve found for thinking and writing in the shower. It&rsquo;s simple but effective. It can flex to accommodate two-word ideas, long chains of thoughts, visuals, and everything in between. Though flashier digital tools like smartwatches and automated home assistants seemed better, I&rsquo;ve found pencil and paper to be the best tool for the job.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say we spend 15 minutes in the shower daily. That&rsquo;s roughly 91 <em>hours</em> in a year. Getting clean is a noble enough way to spend that time, but I&rsquo;d encourage you to also intentionally think and write.</p>
<p>Pay attention to your thoughts and emotions. What comes up might be important. And the important things should be captured, not washed down the drain.</p>

<h3 id="dad-stuff">Dad Stuff</h3>
<p>My daughter is walking! She is almost 15 months old now, and it feels like overnight she transformed from baby to toddler. Crawling to walking took a couple of months, but I think she went from walking to running in an hour. We&rsquo;re chasing her all over the place now. This is such a fun age.</p>
<p>In addition to walking/running, she&rsquo;s getting pretty good at sign language and a few words. Her favorite words right now are dada, mama, baby, blueberries (besbes), bees, go (doe), bottle (baba), wheels on the bus (wuhbuh), book (buhbuh), dog (wohwoh, because our dog&rsquo;s name is Lolo), bye bye, thank you and ball. She&rsquo;s also gotten very good at shaking her head &ldquo;no&rdquo;, and is not afraid to use it. This girl has some sass. It can be challenging, but I am proud that we are encouraging her sense of self and being assertive about her needs even at this young age.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m having a lot of fun spending time with my daughter and playing with her. She is sweet and pure in a way that starkly contrasts the messiness and hustle of the world. She loves giving kisses and hugs. I love watching her walk around kissing her stuffed animals, and then offering them up to me or my wife to kiss them too. I want to soak in every moment I can with her.</p>
<p>And yet&hellip; if I&rsquo;m being completely honest, I find myself having a desire to check out sometimes. My wife and I are working to keep each other accountable to not turning to our phones when we&rsquo;re tired. I know I will be so much happier if I stay present in the moment, but the siren call of distraction can be really strong. I can easily fall into binging articles or videos and justifying it as &ldquo;learning&rdquo;, but it&rsquo;s just my way of turning off to the hard things in front of me.</p>
<h3 id="creating">Creating</h3>
<p>I continue to blog infrequently but love it when I do it. It seems li ke my creative energy comes in waves, and it has been on the upswing recently. I went the whole month of July without posting any articles, but wrote a handful last month. Recently, I redesigned the <a href="https://weidok.al/">homepage</a> of my blog and am pretty happy with how it turned out. I like just seeing a listing of all the things I&rsquo;ve written about, and I imagine that&rsquo;s what others would be interested in too.</p>
<p>A while ago I liked the idea of writing think piece articles where I do a bunch of research to from a novel opinion on a topic of interest, but that hasn&rsquo;t materialized yet. I think maybe it&rsquo;s just not my style? So far, my process is that I get super obsessed with an idea of something I want to write, and I need to get it out of my system within 24 hours. Then I publish it with little to no editing. I&rsquo;m not sure that there&rsquo;s a right or wrong way, but I&rsquo;d still like to at least experiment with a more patient approach to writing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also been working on <a href="https://www.fedmeetup.com/">Fed Meetup</a> more. I had to update it with the FY25 rates that got posted by GSA recently, and while I was in there I cleaned up the interface. There&rsquo;s still a lot of room for improvement, but it&rsquo;s getting better. The worst part about the app right now is the initial load time. It&rsquo;s atrocious, but I&rsquo;m still figuring out how to get things to render correctly and lazy load in SvelteKit. That&rsquo;s the next thing I plan to tackle.</p>
<p>I have ideas for all sorts of other things I&rsquo;d like to create and put together an <a href="https://weidok.al/ideas">ideas page</a> to keep track of them.</p>
<h3 id="work">Work</h3>
<p>My big focuses right now are the NASA Cause Analysis Tool (NCAT) and the NASA Mishap Information System (NMIS). NCAT was the first app that managed from idea all the way to release, and it was released earlier this year. It has been successful so far, and is getting good feedback from the mishap investigator community at NASA. These are the main people using the tool currently, it helps them brainstorm and organize data to determine findings and recommendations as part of their investigations.</p>
<p>NMIS is one of the NASA Safety Center&rsquo;s oldest applications and I recently to over as the product manager for it. It is the source of truth for all NASA mishap data. It is a big legacy app and has a very different feel from NCAT, which is our newest application. NMIS is going through major changes right now since the mishap policy at NASA is changing, and the software needs to change with the policy. It has been fun getting up to speed on NMIS quickly and thinking about how we will implement major changes that touch most parts of the application.</p>
<h3 id="faith-and-friends">Faith and Friends</h3>
<p>The church group my wife and I are a part of has become completely overrun with babies&hellip; When we joined a couple of years ago, there were 0, and now we are well into double digits. We&rsquo;ve all started going in on childcare together, and that has improved the dynamic of the group a lot. It&rsquo;s a lot easier to have deep, meaningful conversation when there aren&rsquo;t a bunch of kids toddling around and screaming.</p>
<p>I feel like my attitude toward my faith has been apathetic for a while, and I&rsquo;m not sure what to do about it. I believe in Christ as my savior, and I believe God is active in my life and with me, but that doesn&rsquo;t impact my heart as much as it used to. This concerns me. I feel a dissonance between my mind and my heart. It makes me wonder if I have allowed myself to get too comfortable? Am I settling for a typical American middle class life, concerned more with status and self-satisfaction than with the grand question of why I am even here? How could I not be moved by my belief that the reason I am here is to honor God and share love with others? I am praying for God to reignite my passion and excitement, but I am still waiting. That is okay, it does not shake the foundation of my faith, but I do feel like I am in a dry valley.</p>
<p>And despite all of these existential questions, I don&rsquo;t want things to change. I really like my comfortable American life. I may be holding onto it too tightly. If I was asked to give it up, I would have a really hard time with that. It puts me in a weird place. I don&rsquo;t really want change, but I am hoping and praying for it.</p>
<h3 id="leisure">Leisure</h3>
<p>I finished the Foundation Series by Isaac Aasimov, and now I am reading a couple different books: Ghost Soldiers, Thus Spake Zarathustra, and Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been disc golfing occasionally when I can and have been playing really well. I played my highest rated round ever couple of days ago.</p>
<h3 id="exercise">Exercise</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been doing a couple sets a day of push-ups to failure, and that has been excellent for me. I&rsquo;ve struggled with making time to go to the gym or even do a full workout at time, and this is so stupid easy that I&rsquo;ve actually been able to keep up with it. I focus on going slow so that I use not just my arms but also my core.</p>
<p>My wife and I also recently got memberships to our local YMCA. We&rsquo;ve gone a couple of times, but I&rsquo;m not sure if we&rsquo;ll stick with it. The place just has a weird feel. I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s too dark, or has a weird smell, but something is just off. I really want to do CrossFit or some sort of other group class like Jiu Jitsu, but those are so expensive that they&rsquo;re tough to justify. They also feel like a little more of a time commitment, but I think that would be good for me. I think commitment is what I need.</p>
<h3 id="home">Home</h3>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been rearranging the house quite a bit. It ended up in a weird setup, so I think we&rsquo;re going to rearrange it all again soon. We&rsquo;re trying to figure out how to have a nice adult space that is also kid-friendly.</p>
<p>Also, we had 5 different contractors come out recently to give us quotes for a back patio. We&rsquo;re looking forward to making our backyard a nice space to entertain friends and let all the kids roam around.</p>

			 <p>I love when I&rsquo;m inspired by something I highlighted a <em>long</em> time ago in my <a href="https://readwise.io">Readwise Daily Review</a>. This one feels especially relevant with my recent excitement around <a href="https://weidok.al/2024/09/18/indie-hacking.html">indie hacking</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I wish I would have known that there was no need to wait. I went to college. I went to law school. I worked in law and banking, though not for terribly long. But not until I started PayPal did I fully realize that you don’t have to wait to start something. So if you’re planning to do something with your life, if you have a 10-year plan of how to get there, you should ask: Why can’t you do this in 6 months? Sometimes, you have to actually go through the complex, 10-year trajectory. But it’s at least worth asking whether that’s the story you’re telling yourself, or whether that’s the reality.</p>

			 <p>I received the following question in my LinkedIn DMs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is some advice you can give me, I am having motivation issues.
I have a decent job but it’s not my dream job, trying to join the aerospace industry.
Also doing my masters to specialize in AI and eventually get a leadership role.
Not seeing the clear path yet and it’s hard to stay motivated.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here was my response:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There&rsquo;s never a clear path! My path has been all over the place, and I never would have guessed I would be where I am now.</p>
<p>I think the key is to do the best you can where you are and always be on the lookout for new opportunities. Reach higher than you think you can go and ignore the requirements in job postings, they&rsquo;re just wish lists.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t expect to get the job I have now. I was terribly underqualified on paper, and just wanted to apply to see what the interview process might be like for the kind of position I might apply for in a few years. And then I got the job!</p>
<p>Also, have fun along the way. If you&rsquo;re early on in your career, look for fun ways that you can boost your visibility and increase your surface area for lucky opportunities. For me, that looks like posting on LinkedIn, starting a blog, working on web apps on the side, etc. Just find stuff you love related to where you want to go, and start now. Find little aerospace projects to work on, or AI projects, or local leadership opportunities.</p>
<p>You got this!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I want to capture this in a post so I can share it with anyone else struggling with the same things. Demotivation like this is really common and I&rsquo;ve dealt with it too.</p>
<p>To anyone else out there struggling with the same thing, you really do got this! Keep moving, keep having fun, and tell people about what you&rsquo;re doing. The right opportunity will come along!</p>
<p>I would be happy to chat over <a href="mailto:jake@weidok.al?subject=Re:%20Advice%20To%20A%20Demotivated%20Job%20Seeker">email</a> about it!</p>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s the beautiful easing into dawn as I write. I&rsquo;m sitting in a rocking chair on the chapel deck, overlooking one of New York&rsquo;s finger lakes. In the middle of the quiet and solitude, a speedboat just ripped across the lake as I finished that last sentence. It&rsquo;s 6:50 a.m. I was up at 5:00, woken by my daughter crying. My back hurts and my neck aches from sleeping on the hard wooden bunk bed of the camp cabin we&rsquo;re staying in.</p>
<p>Despite the aches, pains, and upset baby, I am at peace. My soul is at ease in the morning light over the lake. Now that my wife and daughter have gone back to bed, the seagulls are my only companions.</p>
<p>I had started reading Nietzsche but had to put it down. It&rsquo;s just too&hellip; depressing. Too depressing for the goodness of this moment. Which is ironic, because he was talking about the need for solitude and nature. But he was discussing that need as it relates to all the &ldquo;blood-sucking poison-flies&rdquo; that we encounter in our interactions with other people. Sure, the &ldquo;blood-sucking poison-flies&rdquo; are out there, but I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re as pervasive as Nietzsche thinks. And even if they were, that&rsquo;s not what I want on my mind right now.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m excited for Mikenna and Josh getting married this afternoon. Though it can be stressful, I enjoy the excited energy of being around the wedding party in the days leading up to the wedding.</p>
<p>I used to think weddings were silly. A flashy &ldquo;look at me&rdquo; beginning to a lifelong commitment. I still think they are overemphasized in our culture, but I see the value in them now. Bringing people together and having grand celebrations helps everyone process and incorporate big life changes. This is true also for funerals, grad parties, and other traditional celebration/events for big life changes.</p>
<p>While a wedding is <em>about</em> the bride and groom, it is <em>for</em> everyone. As the attendees at a wedding, we get a shared experience of the start of the couple&rsquo;s journey. We show our support for the couple, and we strengthen bonds with each other, further strengthening the couple&rsquo;s support network. We are reminded of love. We are reminded that love is worth celebrating. We get to be part of a sacred covenant. Hopefully, we put aside our selfish aims for a day and allow the spotlight to be on the couple.</p>
<p>Maybe most importantly, we pause. We recognize that there are things in life worth pausing for. And the greatest of these is love.</p>

			 <p>I have a tendency to be consumed by a niche interest or hobby every now and then. In the past it&rsquo;s been disc golf, counter strike, yo-yoing, hot sauces, coffee, apologetics, and even card magic. Now I&rsquo;m introducing the latest interest that my free-time has fallen victim to: indie hacking.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-indie-hacking">What is Indie Hacking?</h2>
<p>Despite having &ldquo;hacking&rdquo; in the name, indie hacking is not nearly as nefarious as it seems. It does not involve late night attempts to crack the access code to a terminal while 80s synth wave music surges in the background.</p>
<p>Indie hacking is building software products without a large team and without investments from venture capitalists. Many indie hackers set up their businesses as &ldquo;lifestyle businesses&rdquo;, which means that they optimize for time freedom instead of financial growth. So instead of hiring a bigger team to grow the business to infinity and beyond, an indie hacker might set up process automations to make their business run on autopilot so that they can have more time in their day.</p>
<h2 id="my-introduction-to-indie-hacking">My Introduction to Indie Hacking</h2>
<p>I started down this rabbit hole after listening to <a href="%5Bhttps://lexfridman.com/pieter-levels-transcript/%5D(https://lexfridman.com/pieter-levels-transcript/)">Lex Fridman&rsquo;s podcast with guest Pieter Levels.</a> Pieter is notorious in the indie hacker community, and has set up several lifestyle businesses for himself, such as <a href="https://nomads.com/">nomads.com</a>. After being inspired by his journey, I took a look at <a href="%5Bhttps://levels.io/blog/%5D(https://levels.io/blog/)">his blog</a> and a couple of his posts gave me more to look into:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://levels.io/startups/">https://levels.io/startups/</a> - how to take an idea from 0 to 100</li>
<li><a href="https://levels.io/copywriting/">https://levels.io/copywriting/</a> - dead simple advice for writing good copy</li>
<li><a href="https://levels.io/hoodmaps/">https://levels.io/hoodmaps/</a> - a crazy long post documenting how Pieter built an app from the first line of code to being complete</li>
</ul>
<p>Looking at these posts then led me to <a href="%5Bhttps://news.ycombinator.com/show%5D(https://news.ycombinator.com/show)">Show Hacker News</a>, <a href="%5Bhttps://www.indiehackers.com/starting-up%5D(https://www.indiehackers.com/starting-up)">Indie Hackers</a>, and <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/">Product Hunt</a>. <a href="%5Bhttps://news.ycombinator.com/show%5D(https://news.ycombinator.com/show)">Show Hacker News</a> is a great place to see what other people are building and to see how the &ldquo;hacker community&rdquo; responds. <a href="%5Bhttps://www.indiehackers.com/starting-up%5D(https://www.indiehackers.com/starting-up)">Indie Hackers</a> has all sorts of articles and resources with info on getting started. They also have a podcast I just stumbled on today! I had never heard of <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/">Product Hunt</a> before, but it&rsquo;s a place where each day new apps get launched and then voted on. The most popular apps rise to the top, so for the early-adopter community it is a way to see what hot new apps are available, and for makers it is a great way to get visibility and users for a new product.</p>
<h2 id="what-indie-hacking-means-to-me">What Indie Hacking Means To Me</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been inspired by all the stories I&rsquo;ve read and the products I&rsquo;ve seen. My day job is fun and rewarding, but it has become removed from coding. I miss the tight feedback loop of having a small feature in my head to build and then bringing it to life. To reconcile that, I&rsquo;m moonlighting as an indie hacker. I have no grand monetization scheme, no clearly laid out plan, and little free time as a new dad working a full-time job. But I&rsquo;m building nonetheless. My latest creation is <a href="http://fedmeetup.com/">fedmeetup.com</a>, and I just pushed some new updates to it over the last week.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still a bit embarrassed by how wonky the interface looks (need to work on my design skills) but I&rsquo;m trying to embrace the indie hacker mantra of &ldquo;ship early, ship often&rdquo;. Fed Meetup solves a problem (Where should I host a federal in-person event to maximize savings of taxpayer dollars?) in its current form, so I&rsquo;ve released it into the wild and will build it alongside those using it. I know of at least a couple of people at NASA who have started using it and I plan to broadcast it more widely through NASA. Once it has had success at NASA, I&rsquo;ll start outreach to other agencies.</p>
<p>On top of Fed Meetup, I have other ideas that I&rsquo;m itching to build:</p>
<ol>
<li>I want to make an app for prayer that combines the best elements of Duolingo and Readwise. I often tell people I will pray for them and then forget, so I want to build something that solves that. A place I can store the things I want to be praying for, that also reminds me to pray and maybe even has some gamification to encourage me to keep engaging with my prayers.</li>
<li>I also want to make a quick capture app. What I really want to make is a widget for an android or iPhone, that makes it dead simple to capture quick notes and have a running log of these quick notes. I haven&rsquo;t found a satisfying solution for this yet.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve also considered writing a weekly email newsletter that either has a paid subscription option or a donate option. It would have to be something that provides value&hellip; I was thinking either &ldquo;hacks&rdquo; for the average office user to use their computer better, or a weekly interview with someone who works at NASA, highlighting the person and their work.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is just the beginning of my ideas, so I&rsquo;m going to create an /ideas page on this blog to store all of them. I want to share these publicly partly for accountability and partly because I think they need to be built, so I welcome others to build them too! If you have any interesting ideas you think we could work on together, I would love to hear them.</p>
<h2 id="the-piece-im-missing">The Piece I&rsquo;m Missing</h2>
<p>The main way I differ from other indie hackers is that I don&rsquo;t have an intense focus on monetization. I&rsquo;m more of an indie hobbyist, who may one day metamorphose from hobbyist to hacker. Indie hackers are usually very focused on their Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) which is the key measure for a subscription based business. After reviewing my financial situation, my MRR between my blog and Fed Meetup is -$7. I pay $5/mo for blog hosting, and about $1/mo each for my domain names. And none of this is pulling in any money.</p>
<p>For now, I am content with that. I&rsquo;m enjoying the craft of both writing and building software products. It brings me immense joy to write these blog posts and to build things like Fed Meetup. However, I do dream of a day when the side projects I&rsquo;ve built over time could support my family financially. I am quite happy supporting my family through my W-2 job, but I am attracted to the romanticized freedom that having my own business(es) would afford. I know it won&rsquo;t be all sunshine and rainbows, but I think it would fit my personality well.</p>
<p>In my mind, the key to all of this is experimentation. This is not a big announcement of a shift in focus or career for me. Rather, this is me sharing a potential future path that I plan to experiment with. I plan to start small with my hobbyist projects, giving some more thought to how I can monetize them. Actually, I&rsquo;m quite excited about experimenting with monetization and value. Stories like the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/lessonsfromthepast-how-swinmurns-wizard-oz-birthed-obasi-aca--hp69e/">Zappos founder</a>, Nick Swinmurn, fuel my imagination. He set up an online shoe store before having any inventory. While he was validating the company&rsquo;s value proposition (would people buy shoes online without trying them on?), he would receive orders and then go out himself to local shoe stores to buy shoes and ship them out. Finding opportunities for this kind of &ldquo;Wizard of Oz&rdquo; testing to validate business viability is exciting and fun to me.</p>
<p>So why am I sharing all of this? Because you can expect to hear more from me about what I&rsquo;m building. <a href="https://whop.com/blog/building-in-public-guide/">Building in public</a> is about authentically sharing the journey from idea to product. I hope to do just that and I invite you to join me and follow along.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been feeling like my home page wasn&rsquo;t what I really wanted people&rsquo;s first experience with my blog to be. I want people to be able to get a high-level overview of what I write about and what my interests are. I admire other blogs that just have a list of long-form articles, so I decided to update my home page to work similarly.</p>
<p>Check out my new home page at <a href="/">weidok.al</a></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>For anyone else using the Micro.blog Tiny Theme that wants to do the same, here is how I did it:</p>
<h2 id="instructions">Instructions</h2>
<p><em>Warning: Keep in mind that this is one of the more power <a href="https://tiny.micro.blog/microhooks/">microhooks</a> in the Tiny Theme, so it may override other microhooks you have already set up</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure Tiny Theme is installed on the Plug-ins page</li>
<li>create a custom theme (or edit your existing custom theme if you already have one)</li>
<li>add the following page to your theme: layouts/partials/microhook-post-list.html</li>
<li>in that page, add the code below:</li>
</ul>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>&lt;div class=&quot;home h-feed&quot;&gt;
  {{ $posts := where .Site.RegularPages &quot;Type&quot; &quot;post&quot; }}
  {{ $articles := where $posts &quot;Title&quot; &quot;!=&quot; &quot;&quot; }}
  
  {{ range $articles.GroupByDate &quot;2006&quot; }}
    &lt;h2&gt;{{ .Key }}&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;ul class=&quot;post-list&quot;&gt;
      {{ range .Pages }}
        &lt;li class=&quot;h-entry&quot; style=&quot;padding: 0.5em 0;&quot;&gt;
            &lt;div style=&quot;display: flex;&quot;&gt;
                &lt;div class=&quot;post-meta&quot; style=&quot;flex-shrink: 0; width: 60px; margin-right: 10px;&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;time class=&quot;dt-published&quot; datetime=&quot;{{ .Date.Format &quot;2006-01-02T15:04:05Z07:00&quot; }}&quot;&gt;
                        {{ .Date.Format &quot;Jan 02&quot; }}
                    &lt;/time&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;div style=&quot;flex-grow: 1; min-width: 0;&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;a href=&quot;{{ .Permalink }}&quot; style=&quot;word-wrap: break-word; overflow-wrap: break-word;&quot;&gt;{{ .Title }}&lt;/a&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/li&gt;
      {{ end }}
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  {{ end }}
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre><ul>
<li>save the template</li>
</ul>
<p>And voila! Just like that, you&rsquo;ve updated your homepage to show a list of reverse chronological posts, but only showing long-form articles grouped by the year.</p>

			 <p>Today I found myself in the downtown area of an old, little rural Ohio town. Surrounded by brick buildings, with a large, antiquated concrete community bank on the opposite corner. I stopped in at a local Chinese takeout place with my family for lunch. We ordered our food, and were told the customary &ldquo;10 minutes&rdquo;. While waiting for them to prepare our food, I stepped out onto the corner with my daughter.</p>
<p>It was&hellip; unremarkable. Another typical Ohio day in a quaint Ohio town.</p>
<p>But doing unremarkable things with a one year-old can suddenly make them remarkable.</p>
<p>My daughter stared in amazement at the cars going by, talking and waving to each one. She looked one way down the sidewalk and squealed, then turned around quickly and squealed in the other direction. She looked up and squinted as the sun shone on her face and the wind blew her bangs around.</p>
<p>And then strangely, I began to see and hear what was around me. I suppose I am always doing this, but there was something special about being acutely <em>aware</em> of my seeing and my hearing.</p>
<p>I suddenly saw the cars not as background movement, but as amazing marvels of engineering, each unique from the next. I saw the people in them. I saw how focused they were. I imagined their destination, their origin, their goals, their lives. Each so focused on their own. As I usually am.</p>
<p>I saw the buildings around me. I imagined their history. The tenants that each had their moment in the space. The decades of daily visitors passing in and out.</p>
<p>I saw the stop lights. Their simple design. Their rigid schedule. Easily understood.</p>
<p>I smelled the scent of the Chinese restaurant wafting out the door behind me. I heard construction in the distance and cars whooshing by. I felt on my back the gritty texture of the concrete pillar that I leaned against.</p>
<p>I felt what my daughter felt. Not with touch, but with my whole self. I stepped into her joy and her excitement. I looked into her eyes and giggled with her. I squealed at the sidewalk. I waved at the cars.</p>
<p>I transformed from agent to observer. I had no goal in that moment. I simply observed. It was nice. I felt like a little fly on the wall of my tiny corner of the universe, watching time and space move around me.</p>
<p>Usually I move through the world as if I <em>am</em> the universe. My thoughts blind me from what is around me. My thoughts seem to be all that exists. It&rsquo;s a lot being the universe. It&rsquo;s relaxing to not be the universe. To merely be part of it. Especially if you can be part of it with someone you love.</p>
<p>So grab someone you love and go stand on a street corner and look around.</p>

			 <p>I recently had 35 meetings in a week. This is a lot, but not uncommon for employees of large enterprises. While it is easy to lament an organization&rsquo;s &ldquo;meeting culture&rdquo;, there are also actions individual employees can take to reduce their meeting load. I recognized that attending all the meetings on my calendar was not possible (one time slot was quadruple-booked!) so I developed the following approach for responding to meetings.</p>
<p>When a new meeting comes up I figure out what my role will be in the meeting and then decide whether I will attend based on my role.</p>
<h2 id="meeting-roles">Meeting Roles</h2>
<h4 id="1-facilitating">1. Facilitating</h4>
<p>I record my meetings when appropriate. I make sure someone is taking notes, if not me. I send a follow-up email with actions, key info, and notes.</p>
<h4 id="2-contributing">2. Contributing</h4>
<p>If I believe I can benefit the meeting purpose or myself, I will attend and contribute. I send a follow-up email with actions, key info, and notes if I don&rsquo;t think the facilitator will.</p>
<h4 id="3-listening">3. Listening</h4>
<p>Do not attend. Ask for notes and/or watch the recording.</p>
<h2 id="process-for-reviewing-informational-meetings">Process for Reviewing Informational Meetings</h2>
<p>For informational (listening) meetings, I skip them whenever I can. If it is recorded, I can watch the recording on my own time at 1.5x or 2x speed and I can skip around as needed to parts that are relevant to me. If it will not be recorded, I can ask someone else who is attending to take notes for me. If it is not recorded and nobody can take notes, I practice gratitude for not needing to review another meeting and I consider the fact that I don&rsquo;t need to know <em>everything</em>. 🙂</p>
<ul>
<li>Each week, for meetings I plan to skip but want to follow up on, I mark them as &ldquo;free&rdquo; in outlook and categorize them in my &ldquo;Skip&rdquo; category. If unsure whether I will attend, I will mark it as tentative but still put it in the &ldquo;Skip&rdquo; category.</li>
<li>At the end of the week, I open the &ldquo;meet&rdquo; tab in Teams and filter by recorded meetings. I review recordings of meetings I missed in the last week.</li>
</ul>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<ul>
<li>For meetings that were not recorded, I go into Outlook, open the calendar, and type &ldquo;Skip&rdquo; into the search bar. This brings up all the meetings I marked as &ldquo;Skip&rdquo;. If there are any meetings I want to follow up on, I reach out to the organizer or another attendee to ask for their notes.</li>
</ul>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Following this process is helping me to reduce my meeting burden without missing relevant information. I recognize meetings can be important, but I am mindful to weigh their value against my priorities and my organization&rsquo;s priorities.</p>

<p><strong>1</strong> Read more material that endures. Posts and videos are ephemeral. They come and go. Seek out knowledge and stories that have survived years, decades, or centuries.</p>
<p><strong>2</strong> Write as much as you can. Write anything. Document your days. You&rsquo;ll love flipping through old journal entries, and seeing what you were doing. Trap your anxious and messy thoughts on paper, so they don&rsquo;t consume your mind. When confronted with something hard, think through it in writing. It will slow you down, and allow you to evaluate your thoughts more clearly.</p>
<p><strong>3</strong> You have an aversion to conflict. You can feel it in your bones. That&rsquo;s okay. Stay in it, and realize there are many ways to work through conflict. Guide the conflict into a style that you do well with. Conflict can be important, so do not avoid it when it is necessary. Stay calm and explain yourself clearly, even if you need to tremble through it.</p>
<p><strong>4</strong> You have a guilty conscience. This is good because it means you have a sense of morality but beware of people who will try to use that against you. If someone or something is making you feel guilty, pay close attention to the motives.</p>
<p><strong>5</strong> Smile, make eye contact, and when you ask someone how they are, really ask them.</p>
<p><strong>6</strong> The world is lonely without a community that shares your values. As soon as you realize you do not have this, find it. Or make it.</p>
<p><strong>7</strong> You can become a good public speaker. Like conflict, you feel like you need to run from it, but the truth is you must do exactly the opposite. Seek out opportunities to speak in front of others. It will be uncomfortable, but the more you do it, the better you will get. And absolutely practice beforehand, winging it is a terrible idea.</p>
<p><strong>8</strong> Stay open. Much of the good in your life will come from opportunities you didn&rsquo;t foresee at all and had no control over. You might miss them if you keep too tight a grip on what you think you need.</p>
<p><strong>9</strong> Related to the above, don&rsquo;t forget how much you owe to God and luck. You think you know this, but you cannot comprehend its depth.</p>
<p><strong>10</strong> Remember that every lie you tell will be accompanied by a confession, or worse, an exposure. Think of this anytime you consider lying, and do not do it. Lying is like smoking, it builds up tar in your soul.</p>
<p><strong>11</strong> Remember that it&rsquo;s temporary. In the midst of anxiety, it will feel all-consuming and never-ending. It isn&rsquo;t so. It will end.</p>
<p><strong>12</strong> Everybody is fascinating if you ask. So ask, then listen.</p>
<p><strong>13</strong> Initiate connection in your marriage daily. It will not initiate itself.</p>
<p><strong>14</strong> Step up and lead. Getting everyone&rsquo;s opinion and deciding by majority may feel inclusive, but it is not leading. You will need to make tough, uncomfortable, and even unpopular calls. Make them and then bear them.</p>
<p><strong>15</strong> You so desire to be better that you will have a tendency to believe all feedback you receive. Some feedback is neither valid nor helpful. Don&rsquo;t get stirred up over it. Recognize it for what it is, and move on.</p>
<p><strong>16</strong> Say what you want. Especially to your managers at work. People don&rsquo;t know what you want if you don&rsquo;t tell them. Most people will try to help you get what you want if they know what it is.</p>
<p><strong>17</strong> Never disbelieve in what you are capable of. You will learn to love olives. And you will become a master diaper changer. If you can do those, you can do anything.</p>
<p><strong>18</strong> Nourish your curiosity. You do a good job of exploring new things and not caring so much if others think they&rsquo;re weird. In fact, relish in the confused gaze you get when you tell people about your new abstract hobby or interest. Keep doing that.</p>
<p><strong>19</strong> You follow rules really well. Try breaking them more.</p>
<p><strong>20</strong> Just because everyone is doing it, does not mean it&rsquo;s good for you. You are allowed to completely cut yourself off from things that are not good for you.</p>
<p><strong>21</strong> Don&rsquo;t get too obsessed with being better or doing better. You&rsquo;ll lose sight of now, which is bad because it&rsquo;s always now. Be present. Accept what is.</p>
<p><strong>22</strong> Start developing habits to maintain your health. Your high metabolism will not last forever, and avoiding the doctor will only cause more problems later. Get a primary care physician, see a dermatologist, and keep up with the dentist.</p>
<p><strong>23</strong> Don&rsquo;t be ashamed of your age. People use age as a proxy for competence and trustworthiness, so these assumptions will not be given to you easily. Be honest about who you are, and what you are, and lean into your strengths. Wherever you are, you are there for a reason, even if you feel out of place.</p>
<p><strong>24</strong> Please take yourself less seriously. Not everything needs to be about &ldquo;finding signal&rdquo; or doing better. Have fun and be goofy. Don&rsquo;t forget how to take it easy, this seems to get a little harder for you each year.</p>
<p><strong>25</strong> Go to bed earlier and wake up earlier. It&rsquo;s amazing how much better life feels this way.</p>
<p><strong>26</strong> Be less selfish. Think of others more, and make a system to do so if it does not come naturally.</p>

			 <p><em>The following is a message I shared with my organization today.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>In light of NASA&rsquo;s push to train up the workforce on AI, I wanted to share a tool that I&rsquo;ve been using in my day-to-day. This is a simple tool that would be a good introduction for folks who haven&rsquo;t been using AI much.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.perplexity.ai/">Perplexity AI</a> is a conversational AI assistant and search engine that provides citations for sources it is using. You can also specify whether you want it to only search through academic journals, Reddit, or other sources.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using this about as much as I&rsquo;ve been searching for links with Google. I&rsquo;ve been using it for research, learning new things, troubleshooting other tools I use at work, etc. The cited sources help me to see where the answer is coming from, to judge whether I should trust it or not. And it&rsquo;s really easy to use. Just type in a question you want an answer to, and it will give you cited responses.</p>
<p>A lot of the other big LLMs are good too, and each have there own strengths and weaknesses. Perplexity would be happy to tell you what they are!</p>
<p>Some others I&rsquo;ve tried are:</p>
<ul>
<li>ChatGPT, from Open AI: <a href="https://chatgpt.com/">https://chatgpt.com/ </a></li>

<p>I want to write better articles. I want to use them to reason and think. I would like to do <em>some</em> research and link to sources, so that my articles have some ground to stand on and they provide real value.</p>
<p>To this end, I&rsquo;ve been doing some research on writing a good article and I made the cheat sheet below for myself. I don&rsquo;t plan to follow this dogmatically, but it will help me remember what to focus on in different stages of my writing. The following is primarily a reframing of the essay app&rsquo;s <a href="https://essay.app/guide">writing guide</a>, because its advice resonated with me the most of what I found online.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-write-a-kickass-article">How to Write a Kickass Article</h3>
<ol>
<li>Read to get ideas.
<ul>
<li>Books</li>
<li>Articles</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Give yourself plenty of time to write.</li>
<li>Make an outline to start.
<ul>
<li>Shoot for 10ish bullets. Any bigger and it is hard to see the flow of the argument.</li>

<li>Reorder until it makes sense.</li>
<li>Reread the whole thing.</li>
<li>Refine, refine, refine.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Create a new outline - Try reconstructing your argument from memory. What you remember is the good stuff. The rest might be crap. Ponder that.</li>

			 <p>My new shipment from <a href="https://www.gouletpens.com/">The Goulet Pen Company</a> makes it feel like Christmas!</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I ordered their <a href="https://www.gouletpens.com/collections/all-paper/products/notebook-sampler-package-set#">notebook sampler</a> and got a <a href="https://www.gouletpens.com/collections/random-ink-sample-set/products/ink-sample-package-surprise-me#">random ink sample set</a> for free.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve barely tested the notebooks so far, but I&rsquo;m <em>really</em> liking the Goulet notebook with Tomoe River paper. It felt silky smooth and the lines of the ink were the most crisp I&rsquo;ve seen. All the notebooks seem great though. I&rsquo;m going to have fun trying them out!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a little bummed that the Goulet notebook came in the pocket size instead of the passport size, because I use a passport size traveler&rsquo;s notebook as a pocket journal/wallet. In the future, I think I&rsquo;ll be buying the Tomoe River refills instead of the standard Traveler&rsquo;s Notebook (TN) refills. Although TN paper is from Midori and is quite nice too. I found that the TN paper was the most toothy of the notebooks in the sampler.</p>
<p>The notebooks all have &ldquo;premium&rdquo; paper ideal for fountain pens, and include:</p>

<li><a href="https://www.gouletpens.com/products/rhodia-no-12-notepad-black-dot-grid">Rhodia No. 12</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In my random ink sample set I received the eight inks on the left, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.gouletpens.com/products/diamine-terracotta-40ml-bottled-ink">Diamine Terracotta</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.gouletpens.com/products/sailor-ink-studio-143-20ml-bottled-ink">Sailor Ink Studio 143</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.gouletpens.com/products/diamine-onyx-black-30ml-bottled-ink">Diamine Onyx Black</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The other inks pictured on the right were from a sample set I picked up from Goulet a while back.</p>
<p>I still haven&rsquo;t gone in on a full-size bottle of ink. Back in college I had a Pilot Iroshizuku bottle, but I don&rsquo;t remember what I did with it. I think I gave it to a friend. Now I&rsquo;m having fun trying out samples! My journal is eclectic with different colors and shades all over the place, but I like that. It will be fun to look back and see what I was experimenting with at different times.</p>
<p>Maybe someday I&rsquo;ll settle on a nice journal/pen/ink combo I can rock forever, but I&rsquo;m okay if that never happens. Experimentation is where the fun is at!</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p><img src="https://weidok.al/uploads/2024/media.jpg" alt="A journal and Lamy Safari fountain pen on a dark stained wood table"></p>
<p><em>The following was transcribed from the pictured journal entry. I used Google Lens and a LOT of editing.</em></p>
<p>It has been easy to <strong>not</strong> make time to write recently. &ldquo;Busyness&rdquo; is the main culprit, but I&rsquo;ve also been spending time with its less boisterous sibling, distraction. And so here I find myself, back at the roots of my writing practice. The journal. I&rsquo;ve missed the empty page. The empty screen is nice too, in my writing software of choice, but I can&rsquo;t help feeling the weight of the myriad windows/apps/messages vying for my attention. So I&rsquo;ve returned to my empty page. It welcomes my attention and thought, but does not compete for them. It is an escape in plain sight.</p>
<p>The past couple weeks have been especially tricky with a sick daughter who doesn&rsquo;t want to sleep, a busy and understaffed season at work, and all sorts of house projects begging to be completed. All these things are important to give my time to, but I miss having time alone to work through my thoughts. And there is something unique to working through thoughts with pen and paper. It would be interesting to see how a particular thought path might develop differently if done digitally instead of analog. Digital thoughts can be discarded and reshaped much more easily. Analog thoughts are methodical and more planned out. Each word, each sentence, gets much more thought. There is no turning back.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s so fun to see where thoughts lead me. I thought this would be an entry about busyness and distraction, but my mind seems more stuck on the difference between digital and analog mediums for thought exploration. Having a medium to capture your thoughts is useful, but how does the medium shape your thoughts? Is it better to be able to edit and rearrange your thoughts easily, or is it better, to follow a slow, linear progression? Or is it just different? If I had written this digitally, I might have edited the first paragraph to have a smoother segue, but I would have lost the original idea that led me to where I am now. Analog forces a full historical record. It takes a longer time to adjust course or backtrack, but you won&rsquo;t lose where you started. How many beautiful, half-baked thoughts have been lost in the editing phase of digital writing? Yet on the other side of the coin, dead branches should be pruned so that the healthy ones can grow stronger.</p>
<p>It would be nice to have the benefits of both analog and digital. I need someone to build a small microwave-style device that scans a notebook in its entirety, and then some sort of local, air-gapped Al separates and tags the content appropriately, moving it to my note app of choice. A dreamer has to dream. The major downfall of analog is how hard it is to re-surface at a later time. There are indexing and categorization systems that help with this, but they don&rsquo;t come close to what I can do digitally.</p>
<p>The experience of writing something new is so nice in analog though. Flip to an empty page, grab your writing utensil, and get going. I get the physical feedback of the pen, the sound of each stroke on the page, and my writing style is distinctly &ldquo;mine&rdquo;. I contrast that with my phone, where I feel obligated to read each notification before I get started writing. That is, if I even make it there without getting lost chasing a squirrel. It&rsquo;s not as good with a laptop either. I have to pull it out, boot it up, find my app, and make my way to a blank space for writing. It&rsquo;s not too much longer, but it feels so much further away than pen and paper.</p>
<p>This sounds a bit like digital-bashing, but I prefer it in many cases. I&rsquo;ve just been spending too much time there recently, and not enough time with my pen and paper. Here&rsquo;s to more time with my ad-free journal.</p>

			 <p>Compound and leverage are powerful forces to move us toward our desired outcomes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking about these two forces and how they can be used not only to improve finances, but they also apply to other areas of life.</p>
<p>When given consistent effort, some things will compound over time, like interest on money or the growth of a network. If we can identify these things, then we can give them small amounts of consistent effort to see amazing growth over the long term.</p>
<p>On the other hand, leverage can be used to amplify your efforts for outsized returns. In finances, leverage usually means taking on debt to acquire assets. When done right, the assets bring in more dollars than the debt takes out.</p>
<p>Compound plays the long game and trusts that what you put in will build upon itself.</p>
<p>Leverage amplifies your efforts to turn little resources into big value.</p>
<p>Consider the following ways you can put these forces to work for you:</p>
<h2 id="compound">Compound</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Business</strong>- Identify and complete 1 to 3 top tasks each day. You&rsquo;ll be amazed at what you&rsquo;ve done in a year.</li>
<li><strong>Relationships</strong> - Take some time each day to reach out to friends or family. Consistent bits of time devoted to your relationships go a long way.</li>
<li><strong>Network</strong> - Talk to new people and grow your network a little each week. The more it grows the easier it grows.</li>
<li><strong>Money</strong> - Put some of each paycheck toward compound investments. At least put it into a high-yield savings account!</li>
<li><strong>Health</strong> - Brush your teeth twice a day. Floss. Get enough sleep. Eat balanced, normal-sized portions. Exercise a couple times a week. You&rsquo;ll be superhuman in a year.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="leverage">Leverage</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Business</strong> - Spend the time to automate routine tasks. Use templates. Create process automations. Delegate when appropriate.</li>
<li><strong>Relationships</strong> - Leverage other assets for growth in your relationships. Spend lavishly on a loved one to get them a meaningful gift. Use your time to write a heartfelt letter to a friend. Share your skills to help your family.</li>
<li><strong>Network</strong> - Use your network to bring others into your network. Leverage events like conferences to find like-minded people who are also interested in finding you!</li>
<li><strong>Money</strong> - Take on a loan to buy an asset that pays for the loan and then some. The loan lets you buy an asset larger than you could afford on your own, increasing your net worth as debt is paid off. Leveraging money is risky, so be smart and don&rsquo;t over-leverage. Have some reserves to get you out of a pickle if needed.</li>
<li><strong>Health</strong> - Use your doctor! Leverage their years of medical knowledge to better understand your specific health situation.</li>
</ul>
<p>What other ways are you using compound and leverage? I&rsquo;m very curious to know!</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m worried about my blog undergoing a LinkedInification. A lot of my recent posts have been good candidates to cross post on LinkedIn, but when I&rsquo;m cross posting there I feel the tug to tweak my style for better &ldquo;engagement&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want that to drive what I write or how I write, so I&rsquo;m keeping an eye on it. I kinda like the idea of writing a full post on the blog, and then throwing a shorter summary version on LinkedIn, but that sounds like too much work.

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Yesterday was NASA&rsquo;s very first Agile Technical Interchange Meeting! NASA is becoming agile 🚀🏃‍♂️💨</p>
<p>I learned how Agile is applied outside of my discipline, web software, to improve how we build hardware and integrated systems, particularly in the systems engineering discipline.</p>
<p>Here are some ✨highlights✨ of NASA&rsquo;s agile journey:</p>
<p>💙 Agile = respect. Tears were shed during a cybersecurity team&rsquo;s transition to SAFe (Scaled Agile Framework). Years of pent-up frustration and pain came out as the team realized how unseen they felt due to working in a very reactive manner, with requests coming in all over the place and no visibility into what they were accomplishing. Now their capacity is clearly understood by their customers and their leadership, and they are delivering more and happier than ever before.</p>
<p>✈ Architecture affects agility. A team rearchitected their software to leverage microservices for coordinating drone traffic in lower-atmosphere urban air space. The architecture change has allowed them to be much more agile in how they deploy software.</p>
<p>🌐 NASA does open-source!? I heard from the OpenMDAO team about how they are building open-source software from NASA, and how adapting an agile mindset has allowed them to respond and work with the open-source community.</p>
<p>🔬 An agile mindset helps deliver valuable research. Much research happens at NASA, and adopting an agile mindset/approach is helping researchers think about how they deliver value with their research. This approach is not taught in doctorate programs, so it was fascinating to see the melding of these concepts and how important it is that NASA is thoughtful about what value our research products can deliver!</p>
<p>We have a ways to go, but we&rsquo;re on our way! I&rsquo;m looking forward to staying connected with this community and seeing what else can be done with an agile mindset at NASA - National Aeronautics and Space Administration!</p>

<h3 id="dad-stuff">Dad Stuff</h3>
<p>My daughter is 10 months old! Time is flying. It seems like she has learned something new every couple of days. As I write, the newest developments are that her top front teeth are coming in, she&rsquo;s loving waving and clapping, we&rsquo;re trying out cloth diapers, and when we ask her to say &ldquo;dada&rdquo; or &ldquo;mama&rdquo; she consistently replies &ldquo;dada&rdquo; to either.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m soaking up every moment with her, particularly laying on the floor and letting her crawl over and attack me while we giggle together. I got teary-eyed the other day as I held her while she slept and I thought about how someday I won&rsquo;t be able to hold her anymore and these days will feel like a distant, warm memory. All the more reason to really be present, put the phone down, and take in each moment as completely as I can.</p>
<h3 id="creating">Creating</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been feeling extra creative lately! I&rsquo;ve been writing on the blog, I set up a digital garden at <a href="https://garden.weidok.al">garden.weidok.al</a>, which I am mostly using to share my sermon notes and Readwise notes, and I created an app called <a href="https://weidok.al/2024/05/03/introducing-fed-meetup.html">Fed Meetup</a>! I would have thought that becoming a dad meant I would have way less time, but somehow it has opened me up to being more creative. Funny how things work out not at all how I expect!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also been considering starting up a newsletter. I like the idea of having a commitment to write weekly within a single topic, and writing about something that is useful to others. The newsletter would be for average computer users/office workers, and would be about tips to use a computer just a little bit better. Things like hotkeys, workflows, apps, lesser-known parts of the OS, or anything that could help people be just a touch more efficient on a computer. If that sounds like something you would read and subscribe to, <a href="mailto:jake@weidok.al">let me know</a>!</p>
<h3 id="work">Work</h3>
<p>We launched the NASA Cause Analysis Tool! I&rsquo;ve been the product manager for this app since it was approved to be funded back in April of last year, and it&rsquo;s hard for me to believe that we already have working production software! Now that it&rsquo;s released, we&rsquo;re focused on releasing it, again and again. There&rsquo;s a lot more functionality yet to be added, but I&rsquo;m excited to have it available to users so we can get feedback as we build new increments. I&rsquo;d like to write a post sharing more about this.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s performance review time of the year at NASA, so I just finished up my self-assessment and feedback for coworkers. I&rsquo;m learning to love this time of year, as it forces me to reflect on the past year, which is something I would like myself to do anyways. I&rsquo;m thinking about writing a blog post about my highlights from this year at NASA.</p>
<p>There are so many exciting things going on right now, some of them I briefly mentioned in <a href="https://weidok.al/2024/04/30/a-day-in.html">my post about my day earlier this week</a>. While it&rsquo;s busy, I feel fortunate to be in this place at this time. I would have never thought I&rsquo;d be doing all these cool things and working on projects that reach across the whole agency.</p>
<h3 id="faith-and-friends">Faith and Friends</h3>
<p>So many babies are being born! I&rsquo;m not sure how many since my last update, but I think we&rsquo;ve added around 5 new babies among our church group since then. It has been fun sharing the joy with everyone and helping out by participating in meal trains.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been really enjoying taking sermon notes in Obsidian, and then <a href="https://garden.weidok.al/notes/110-sermons/">publishing them to my digital garden</a> to share with my friends since we usually talk about the sermon from the past week when we get together on Thursday evenings. I&rsquo;d like to write a post about how I&rsquo;m using Obsidian on my phone to take sermon notes. With markdown formatting, Obsidian is so much easier to to format on-the-fly than other note-taking apps I&rsquo;ve tried in the past. And I like digital better than analog for sermon notes because it&rsquo;s searchable, I can easily copy/paste snippets of scripture, and I can take pictures during the sermon if needed and add them into the notes.</p>
<h3 id="lawn-care">Lawn Care</h3>
<p>That time of year has rolled around again&hellip; I&rsquo;m focused on lawn care. I have a lot to learn here! When our house was built two years ago, they didn&rsquo;t do a great job rockhounding the soil, so it&rsquo;s tough and rocky and the grass comes up in patches. I tried re-seeding last year which helped a little, but not too much. I think I need to aerate.</p>
<p>Anyways, most of our grass is sickly but we had a couple of patches that grew up really fast and thick. They grew way quicker than I expected, so by the time I cut them they were too tall and I killed them so now we have some yellow patches in the back.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re planning to redo our flower beds soon. Those were installed for us but with no weed barrier or defined edge, so that has gotten out of control. I&rsquo;m going to re-edge it and put in some landscaping rock instead of mulch because I do not want to deal with mulch every year.</p>
<h3 id="leisure">Leisure</h3>
<p>In between everything above, I&rsquo;m trying to make time for <a href="https://weidok.al/2024/04/28/beautiful-day-out.html">disc golf with friends</a> every now and then so they don&rsquo;t pass me up :) I&rsquo;ve also been enjoying reading <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29581.Foundation_and_Empire?from_search=true&amp;from_srp=true&amp;qid=Ko73QCm0g0&amp;rank=1">&ldquo;Foundation and Empire&rdquo; by Isaac Asimov</a>.</p>
<h3 id="exercise">Exercise</h3>
<p>Yeah&hellip;. Not been doing great here. With all my creative passion recently, I&rsquo;ve thrown exercise to the side. I&rsquo;m looking to change that though. The doc says I have elevated cholesterol and triglycerides, so it&rsquo;s time to take exercise seriously and back off the carbs. I&rsquo;m sad about taking time away from all the things above that I love, but there&rsquo;s plenty of &ldquo;gray&rdquo; time in my day where I&rsquo;m just distracted that I could take from instead. And I know from the past that getting into a good exercise routine will just bring me more energy and vigor, so it will be additive rather than subtractive. My wife and I tried some YouTube yoga together yesterday, but then as we were about to enter child&rsquo;s pose she noticed a small spider in front of her face and that abruptly ended our session!</p>

			 <p>Now that we are out of the pandemic, federal travel is back in full swing. Federal employees are flying cross-country to get together and meet on various topics to do their work more effectively. I see this, especially at my organization, NASA. Just this winter I flew out to Kennedy Space Center for the Office of Safety and Mission Assurance Face-to-Face with more than 50 other colleagues to talk about where the organization is going and to do workshops together. We do these twice a year.</p>
<p>Multiply 2x per year times the number of employees traveling, and then multiply that by all the other sub-organizations at NASA doing similar events and that adds up to a LOT of annual travel costs. But NASA is just one piece of the federal puzzle and a rather small piece at that. In 2023 NASA&rsquo;s $28.3 billion budget only accounted for 0.3% of the federal budget as shown in this graphic from <a href="https://www.usaspending.gov/explorer/agency">usaspending.gov</a>.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2 id="the-challenge-of-planning-group-travel">The Challenge of Planning Group Travel</h2>
<p>Planning travel for large organizations is hard. When you combine the number of different origins travelers will be coming from with the different destinations they could travel to, it becomes difficult to understand the combinations. How do you compare the costs of your destinations? Right now, this is done by gut feel.</p>
<p>Closer destinations or ones that already have people living there are probably cheaper, right? Well, usually, yes, in simple situations. But not always, and this can get complex when you have different amounts of travelers living in various potential destinations. Or what if you have people all across the country? How do you triangulate and weigh the &ldquo;closest&rdquo; city between all travelers? Not to mention some farther cities have cheaper airfare costs than closer cities. AND to even further complicate it, you need to consider each city&rsquo;s cost of living, which contributes to Meals &amp; Incidentals Expenses.</p>
<p>Do you have a headache too?</p>
<h2 id="introducing-fed-meetup">Introducing Fed Meetup</h2>
<p>I created <a href="https://fedmeetup.com">Fed Meetup</a> to help federal travel planners optimize their destinations for large in-person meetings. It uses publicly available city pair and per diem rate data to compare travel costs for in-person events across multiple destinations.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h3 id="how-does-it-work">How Does It Work?</h3>
<p>First, enter how many <strong>days</strong> long the event will be and the <strong>month</strong> of travel. This is used to calculate per diem rates, which fluctuate in some locations based on the month.</p>
<p>Next, input the various <strong>origins</strong> each traveler will be coming from, along with the number of travelers coming from the origin. Right now, you can specify an origin as either a NASA Center or an Airport. In the future, I plan to provide other predefined origins for agencies other than NASA. If you work at an agency and want your locations added to their own list, reach out to me and I&rsquo;d be happy to work with you.</p>
<p>Once you have entered your origins, it&rsquo;s time to select the <strong>destinations</strong> you would like to compare. There are two options for adding destinations:</p>
<ol>
<li>Add bulk destinations from a preset (currently the only option is All NASA Centers. I plan to add locations for other agencies in the future)</li>
<li>Add individual destinations by airport or NASA Center.</li>
</ol>
<p>After you&rsquo;ve followed the steps above, you&rsquo;re ready to <strong>submit</strong> and let Fed Meetup work its magic! Fed Meetup will run its calculations and provide you with a ranked list of destinations from cheapest to most expensive. If a direct flight can not be found for an origin-destination pair, that destination is ranked lower in the results and marked with an asterisk to indicate the total cost does not include airfare for that origin-destination pair. For each result, you can see the total cost, airfare cost, and per diem cost.</p>
<h3 id="why-build-this">Why Build This?</h3>
<p>Fed Meetup was born out of a <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/stmd/stmd-prizes-challenges-crowdsourcing-program/center-of-excellence-for-collaborative-innovation-coeci/nasa-spark/">NASA Spark</a> campaign. The campaign was looking for existing tools that could be used to evaluate the best meeting locations for large meetings, specifically using federal city-pair and per diem rates. No such tool existed, so I decided to build my own. I was looking for a fun side project that was useful, so this was a great fit! All-in it took me about 15 hours to build this app. I&rsquo;m proud that I was able to get it completed within the two-week timeframe I had before the Spark campaign closed, but there is a lot that I would like to improve.</p>
<h3 id="future-plans">Future Plans</h3>
<p>Remember how NASA was only 0.3% of the federal budget? My grand vision for Fed Meetup is to get it into the hands of as many federal agencies as I can. It&rsquo;s free and open to anyone to use, so my hope is that agencies will find it useful and adopt it to make their travel spending more efficient. All Americans benefit when taxpayer dollars are used more prudently.</p>
<p>To make that grand vision possible, there are lots of little improvements I&rsquo;d like to make. This is more of a grocery list than a roadmap, but you have to start somewhere, right?</p>
<ul>
<li>🎨 Improve the design. Right now it is very wordy. Experience is not as good on mobile. Simplify the interface and make it more intuitive.</li>
<li>🏙 Allow users to select cities as origins and destinations.</li>
<li>✈Related to the above, for cities that have multiple airports (Washington D.C.) the tool would select the cheapest airport pair for that city.</li>
<li>🧮 Update the results to show more info about how the calculation was made. This would allow users to fact-check the results and trust them more.</li>
<li>❗ Improve form validation when there are input errors, so it is clear what needs to be changed.</li>
<li>ℹ Add an &ldquo;About&rdquo; page that describes the tool and why it exists - link to this post???</li>
<li>🏛 Add preset origins/destinations for other agencies (e.g., &ldquo;All Department of Energy Locations&rdquo;). 💡 If you are from another agency, please reach out and help me get the locations set up for your agency!</li>
<li>🍃 Consider carbon footprint in the calculation and results. I would need a data source for these calculations. I have not looked into this yet.</li>
<li>🚗 If traveling between close cities, calculate Privately Owned Vehicle mileage and compare it with airfare prices.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="now-what">Now What?</h2>
<p>Time to spread the word! I&rsquo;ll be out evangelizing Fed Meetup to those who need to know about it. If you work in a federal agency, send it to the person in your area who organizes travel. Have them try it out.</p>
<p>If you use Fed Meetup, send me some feedback. My email inbox and LinkedIn DMs are open!</p>
<p>Safe travels!</p>

			 <p>On days like today,  I marvel as I reflect all the awesome things I get to do in my role here at the NASA Safety Center.</p>
<p>Today I&hellip;</p>
<p>🐛 Hosted a &ldquo;bug hunt&rdquo; for the new app we launched last month, having the whole development team try to break the app to catch bugs before they become an issue.</p>
<p>🌒 Spoke with someone from the Human Landing System program about their interest in using a fishbone (Ishikawa) diagram to identify what could cause the lunar lander to tip over during landing. This is a problem that has plagued recent commercial lunar landings, and we are looking to support these use cases in our new app.</p>
<p>🥗 Ate a fantastic salad with my team at the café in the new Research Support Building at NASA Glenn Research Center</p>
<p>🤹‍♀️ Consulted with a co-worker about how we could use Microsoft Delve to surface Reliability Engineers in the agency with unique skills that could be shared with others in that discipline.</p>
<p>📊 Reviewed the Science Mission Directorate&rsquo;s system for tracking risks to inform how our team will build an agency-level tool that surfaces elevated risks from the mission directorates.</p>
<p>👬 Demoed our API for mishap data to a group building a Digital Twin of NASA facilities. Mishap data could be layered with information we have on aging infrastructure to build a compelling case for which areas of NASA&rsquo;s infrastructure are in the most need of attention.</p>
<p>And that all is just the tip of the iceberg! Looking forward to tomorrow!</p>

			 <p>Gotta get back on the ol' blog! I&rsquo;ve been working a bit on a draft of an article, but have been having some resistance to finishing it. Do I keep it long and playful like it is now, or cut the fluff and get right to the message?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been pondering this question, and I think the right answer is to just get the dang thing out into the world. Have fun writing it. The style does not matter. Either way, it will be a hit with some people and a miss with others. And that doesn&rsquo;t matter anyways. I want to write for me to work through things and hopefully that helps others along the way. But if not, fine!</p>

			 <p><strong>Me</strong>: &ldquo;Oh, I need to respond to that later.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Text Message</strong>: <em>cries softly as it floats into the void, never to be seen again</em></p>
<h2 id="text-message-chaos-and-overwhelm">Text Message Chaos and Overwhelm</h2>
<p>Until recently, I&rsquo;ve managed my text messages differently from email or work-related instant messaging.</p>
<p>I never did anything with text messages other than collect hundreds upon hundreds of conversations that sat in a chronological heap waiting to welcome me each time I opened my messaging app.  Conversations that needed a response would get intermixed with ones that did not need a response and would get buried as more messages were received in yet other conversations. I don&rsquo;t receive a <em>ton</em> of text messages, but with no system at all to handle them, I felt overwhelmed when opening my messaging app and was ghosting a lot of people as a result.</p>
<p>This led to some cognitive dissonance where I felt like a wizard in the world of email, but I felt like a Neanderthal when it came to responding to friends and family over text.</p>
<h2 id="my-text-message-triage-system">My Text Message Triage System</h2>
<p>Now my process for handling texts is similar to my process for emails. Conceptually, I think of my messaging app like my email inbox, with each conversation being like an extremely long-running email thread.</p>
<p>For each message I receive, I work through the following questions:</p>
<h3 id="1-can-this-conversation-be-deleted">1. Can This Conversation Be Deleted?</h3>
<p>Bye-bye spam. I don&rsquo;t delete many conversations because they don&rsquo;t take up much storage anyway, but if it&rsquo;s something I know I will never revisit then I burn it with fire and move on with my day.</p>
<h3 id="2-is-this-message-just-for-reference">2. Is This Message Just for Reference?</h3>
<p>Archive it! If I don&rsquo;t need to respond, then conversations go straight to my archive where they can still be searched and retrieved.</p>
<h3 id="3-can-i-respond-in-2-minutes">3. Can I Respond In 2 Minutes?</h3>
<p>Just do it! Future-me has better things to do and doesn&rsquo;t need the cognitive overhead of thinking about needing to respond. Knock this out now.</p>
<p>After I&rsquo;ve responded, I archive the conversation to get it out of my inbox. The only exception is if I am awaiting a quick response and I will want to follow up if I don&rsquo;t receive one. Then it stays in the inbox.</p>
<h3 id="4-do-i-need-to-respond-but-cant-right-now">4. Do I Need to Respond, But Can&rsquo;t Right Now?</h3>
<p>This one is a more context dependent.</p>
<p>If I can&rsquo;t respond because <em>I just don&rsquo;t have time</em>, then the message stays in the inbox. Unread or read, doesn&rsquo;t matter. If it&rsquo;s in the inbox, I need to get to it.</p>
<p>If <em>I need to do something before I can respond</em>, then that gets transferred to my to-do list, and I leave the message in the inbox.</p>
<h2 id="other-notes-on-my-system">Other Notes on My System</h2>
<h3 id="some-group-chats-stay-in-the-inbox">Some Group Chats Stay in The Inbox</h3>
<p>I would love to get to complete inbox-zero and archive EVERYTHING, but with Google Messages if I archive a group chat, it is clunky to start a new message to the chat. So, I leave three of my high-volume group chats in my inbox at all times.</p>
<h3 id="use-swipe-actions">Use Swipe Actions</h3>
<p>Swipe right to delete a conversation, swipe left to archive it. This helps me move through messages quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They see they can and must stand up, because they begin to understand how genuinely monstrous they will become, otherwise, feeding on their resentment, transforming it into the most destructive of wishes. To say it again: There is very little difference between the capacity for mayhem and destruction, integrated, and strength of character. This is one of the most difficult lessons of life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>- <a href="https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/">Jordan B. Peterson</a>, <a href="https://a.co/d/5q4bKF2">12 Rules for Life</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To be good, you must be dangerous.</p>
<p>Much of my life, I equated dangerous with bad. But I have come to realize that a chief aim of the good ought to be to increase their dangerousness. This is necessary when operating in and around evil.</p>
<p>A capacity for evil is not inherently bad. Your capacity is morally neutral, but it is up to you to wield it appropriately. C.S. Lewis illustrates this well when answering the question of why there is evil at all:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;‘Why did God make a creature of such rotten stuff that it went wrong?’ The better stuff a creature is made of—the cleverer and stronger and freer it is—then the better it will be if it goes right, but also the worse it will be if it goes wrong. A cow cannot be very good or very bad; a dog can be both better and worse; a child better and worse still; an ordinary man, still more so; a man of genius, still more so; a superhuman spirit best—or worst—of all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>- <a href="https://www.cslewis.com/us/">C.S. Lewis</a>, <a href="https://a.co/d/eLUvhU1">Mere Christianity</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jesus makes this point too, when telling his disciples that they ought to be wise as serpents. This is potent imagery considering it was a serpent that caused the fall of man.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Behold, I am sending you out as sheep in the midst of wolves, so be wise as serpents and innocent as doves.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2010%3A16&amp;version=ESV">Matthew 10:16 ESV</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>He implores them to wield the wisdom of the serpent with the innocence of the dove. Why not just tell them to be innocent as doves? Because to be good, you must be dangerous.</p>
<p>This then, is the aim of the good: to be cleverer and stronger and freer. To be dangerous.</p>

			 <p>Below is the template I created for writing user stories.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code># User Story

As a...  
I want...  
So that...  

# Description

Lorem...

# Acceptance Criteria

- bullet criteria

GIVEN setup  
WHEN action  
THEN result  
</code></pre><p>I write a lot of user stories for my team, and they need to be clear, to the point, and verifiable. This template was born out of a need for consistency in how user stories were defined and written and aims to give a development team the bare minimum they need to deliver a hot, fresh slice of valuable software. Nothing here is ground-breaking, but it serves as a foundation for defining work when building software.</p>
<h1 id="user-story-statement-section">User Story Statement Section</h1>
<p>First, we start with the traditional user story statement.</p>
<p>As a<br>
I want<br>
So that</p>
<p>This forces the author of the story to be clear about who wants what, and most importantly, <em>why</em> they want it.</p>
<p>For the <code>As a</code> clause, try to be clear about a specific type of person. If your description can conjure up a mental picture of a distinct archetypal user-type, you&rsquo;re doing it right. Avoid writing simply <code>As a user</code> at all costs. We&rsquo;ve all done it, and we should all be ashamed.</p>
<p>In your <code>I want</code> section, describe <strong>one</strong> want. If you are tempted to have more than one clause here, you might consider if an additional user story is warranted.</p>
<p>With the <code>So that</code> clause, focus intently on the unique value this will provide to your archetypal user-type. This is the hardest clause to write, but also the most important to do well. It&rsquo;s value may be obscure to some, because it does not directly contribute to the &ldquo;spec&rdquo; of what needs built. But this is your chance to clearly define the impact of this work to be done. It breathes life into the code to be written, and gives your designer, developer, tester, etc. a clear reason for doing what they&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<h1 id="description-section">Description Section</h1>
<p>This is your chance to go into more detail about your user story. What should the user-facing phrasing be? What data are we working with?</p>
<p>I often will take a first pass at this providing as much important context and detail as I can from the product perspective. Sometimes, a developer will go into description after I&rsquo;ve written it and add a subsection for <code>Technical Details</code> to go more in depth on any technical nuances to the user story that should be considered during development and testing.</p>
<h1 id="acceptance-criteria-section">Acceptance Criteria Section</h1>
<p>Acceptance criteria gives the team a clear basis to know when they are done with a user story. It is something we can point to and either say &ldquo;Yes, we accomplished what we wanted to&rdquo; or &ldquo;No, this doesn&rsquo;t do everything we needed&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I write acceptance criteria one of two ways, and sometimes I use both.</p>
<h2 id="bullet-syntax">Bullet Syntax</h2>
<p>Acceptance criteria can be a simple bullet-list. This is more often the case for smaller user stories, or ones that are more technical. This can be a simple, useful tool to include any non-functional requirements that need to be met to accept the user story.</p>
<h2 id="gherkin-syntax">Gherkin Syntax</h2>
<p>When it makes sense, I write acceptance criteria in GIVEN, WHEN, THEN format. This lays out a very clear path for manually testing the user story, and this syntax can be used for behavior driven development. It becomes an executable spec that we can use directly in our automated tests.</p>
<h1 id="example">Example</h1>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an example of a user story I&rsquo;ve written recently:</p>
<blockquote>
<h1 id="user-story">User Story</h1>
<p><strong>As a</strong> case owner or admin<br>
<strong>I want</strong> to add users to my case<br>
<strong>So that</strong> I can collaborate with others<br>
<strong>And</strong> determine appropriate access levels for CRUD operations</p>
<h1 id="description">Description</h1>
<p>link to mockups</p>
<p>The scope of this ticket includes setting up roles in the application. See the roles matrix for the case-specific roles in the application.</p>
<p>Add a button in the top right to add case members (see mockups, only visible for case owners and admins).</p>
<p>Owners and admins can add other members. The owner can add Admins, but Admins cannot add other Admins.</p>
<p>After clicking the button, the user selects a person and a role, and then can save them as a member to the case. After saving, the new member should be displayed in the case members table.</p>
<p>The role options will be&hellip;</p>
<ul>
<li>Case Roles
<ul>
<li><strong>Admin</strong> (CRUD, only visible to case owner)</li>
<li><strong>Contributor</strong> (CRU, D data they created. Can remove items from diagram)</li>
<li><strong>Report Editor</strong> (R, U report section)</li>
<li><strong>View Only</strong> (R)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that &ldquo;Owner&rdquo; is not one of the role options, because the owner is whoever created the case and there will only ever be one owner per case.</p>
<h1 id="acceptance-criteria">Acceptance Criteria</h1>
<p><strong>GIVEN</strong> I am a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(owner, case admin)<br>
<strong>WHEN</strong> I add a member as a contributor<br>
<strong>THEN</strong> the member is displayed in the case members table with the contributor role</p>
<p><strong>GIVEN</strong> I am a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(contributor, report editor, view only)<br>
<strong>THEN</strong> I do not see the button to add a member</p>
<p><strong>GIVEN</strong> I am &ldquo;case admin&rdquo;<br>
<strong>WHEN</strong> I am selecting the role for a new member<br>
<strong>THEN</strong> I can not select &ldquo;case admin&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While this template helps define the user story, it is important to remember that the user story is a placeholder for conversation. If you write this up and then immediately push it to your team to work on it, you&rsquo;re missing the beauty of the user story. Bring your draft of the user story before the team and then have a conversation about it. Invite ideas and questions from others on the team. Define and come to a common understanding of the problem to be solved, or the value to be delivered. Then determine how you will bring forth that solution or value.</p>

			 <p>I added a <a href="/blogroll">blogroll</a> to my site! I had been thinking about creating this for a while, and the new <a href="https://help.micro.blog/t/recommendations/2671">recommendations</a> feature in Micro.blog gave me the push to finally do it. I added it to my navigation links, but&hellip; it&rsquo;s getting really crowded up there. I may have to do something about that, but I want people to be able to find my blogroll, and putting a link in any of my other pages didn&rsquo;t seem quite right.</p>
<p>For now, it is just a list of sites, but I&rsquo;d like to add little one-liner descriptions of why I like each site. I&rsquo;ve had a lot of fun discovering blogs through the blogrolls of others, and I&rsquo;m excited to start to share my own recommendations! My list will grow as I discover new blogs. Right now I&rsquo;ve been finding a lot of interesting blogs by clicking around at <a href="https://blogroll.org/">https://blogroll.org/</a> and <a href="https://ooh.directory/">https://ooh.directory/</a>. These are awesome resources to find independent folks sharing from their own space on the web.</p>
<p>My favorite way to discover sites though is through personal recommendations. The more organic, the better. Here&rsquo;s my rank order of favorite ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>A personal 1:1 recommendation - &ldquo;Jake! You gotta check out&hellip;.&rdquo;</li>
<li>A link in a post I&rsquo;m enjoying (falling down a rabbit hole)</li>
<li>A blogroll on a personal site</li>
<li>A blog listing site (like those linked above)</li>
</ol>
<p>If you have some blogs I need to check out or other ways of discovering blogs, I&rsquo;d love to hear about them!</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m adding a <a href="https://weidok.al/categories/haiku/">new category on my site for haiku</a>. Most of these will be quick micro-posts, but others may be longer. I have an idea for an interactive haiku but I&rsquo;m not positive how that will work since my posts are published in Markdown. It should be a fun mini-project!</p>
<p>To my chagrin, I tend towards rule-following, so most of my haiku will follow the 5-7-5 format. I would like to experiment outside of those lines from time to time.</p>
<p>Here are some haiku I&rsquo;ve been workshopping in my pocket journal:</p>
<p>whatever you do<br>
must matter so you enjoy<br>
whatever you do</p>
<p>I will be faithful<br>
all of my days are for you<br>
no one else will do</p>
<p>flowers dance in wind<br>
clouds amble along slowly<br>
people collect likes</p>
<p>quite peculiar<br>
is the love of a small child<br>
pure, strong, undeserved</p>
<p>oh you fool! live more!<br>
think often of your deathbed<br>
it is near, not far</p>
<p>look how far I ran<br>
so far to be same old me<br>
right where I began</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p><a href="https://weidok.al">My website</a> looked quite different at its beginning. I thought starting a blog would be a good opportunity to play around with new technology, so I decided to teach myself <a href="https://kit.svelte.dev/">SvelteKit</a> and build my site with it. It was very exciting: I would build in SvelteKit, write all my posts as standalone markdown files, and deploy on <a href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a>. As I started building and exploring what other people had done to get inspiration, I came across a concept called the <a href="https://indieweb.org/">IndieWeb</a>. I felt aligned with the values of this web community, so I wanted to build my site to be part of it. Suddenly, my to-do list was expanding rapidly to include all sorts of IndieWeb specs and principles. Would markdown files be enough to do everything I wanted to do? Perhaps I would need to set up a database using something like <a href="https://supabase.com/">Supabase</a>&hellip;</p>
<p>The more I added to my to-do list for the site, the more I began to dread working on it. This was supposed to be fun, what happened?</p>
<p>I lost my Why. What I <em>really</em> wanted was to start writing. To have a place to share myself and to figure out how to do that. That was my Why. But I wasn&rsquo;t clear on that. I thought this site would be a good place to write <em>and</em> be a fun coding project. Mixing those was a mistake for me. I became so consumed with perfecting the design and functionality that I had no time to think about writing.</p>
<p>So what to do? I had this thing that I built, that I actually quite liked, but it was taking me further from my Why rather than toward it.</p>
<p>I decided to tear it all down.</p>
<p>I threw everything away and started from a blank slate. How could I just write? How could I stay connected to my Why? A blogging platform, duh! Other people have already solved the problem of creating a website whose primary purpose is publishing writing. In fact, <a href="https://www.manton.org/">Manton</a> over at <a href="https://micro.blog/">Micro.blog</a> solved that problem <em>and</em> built his solution on the IndieWeb principles I admire, so that was the clear choice for me. I took everything I had written and migrated it over to Micro.blog, abandoning my SvelteKit project.</p>
<p>After the migration, everything felt better. I had space to write, space to bring forth my Why. I still couldn&rsquo;t keep myself from customizing themes and plugins to make the site my own, but a little bit of play is okay as long as it leaves my Why undisturbed.</p>
<p>Why had this not been obvious in the beginning? Well for one, I didn&rsquo;t even know about Micro.blog or the IndieWeb when I started out. But more importantly, my thinking had been clouded by an unclear Why and a fear of judgment, which I&rsquo;ve come to realize are connected. My fear was something like, &ldquo;This is supposed to be a web software guy and he didn&rsquo;t build his own site from scratch? He must not <strong>really</strong> know his stuff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a silly fear. Who cares? Have you seen all the intelligent people working in the web space that host their sites on a platform? They&rsquo;re everywhere! And yet, I could not come to that realization until I was really clear on my Why.</p>
<p>I share all of this to implore you to evaluate your Why. Do you have the right Why? Are you clear on it? Is what you&rsquo;re doing moving you in the right direction? If not, it&rsquo;s very possible that you can make minor course corrections to get you back on track. You should try that first. But if you&rsquo;ve gotten far away from your Why, don&rsquo;t be afraid to tear it all down. It&rsquo;s okay to start at zero. The sunk cost has already sunk, so don&rsquo;t drown yourself trying to save it.</p>
<p>Tearing it all down is not the fastest way to do a thing, but it may be the way to do <em>the right</em> thing.</p>
<hr>
<p>Here are some screenshots of what the site looked like before. I had a v1 for my homepage, which was ripped off from this YouTube video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylCUH6LkW80&amp;ab_channel=Smoljames">Build &amp; Deploy a Modern Web Portfolio w. SvelteKit &amp; TailwindCSS (youtube.com)</a>. That felt fake and not like my own, so I started to simplify it into a v2 before deciding to tear it all down.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I appreciate this reframing of a blog post as a &ldquo;piece of my self&rdquo;. As I set out in the early stages of my blog, this captures quite well what I aspire for it to be. Each post is one tiny piece of me, a snapshot in time of one aspect of my self I thought worth sharing. Brought together as a whole, they tell a scattered story of my wanderings.</p>
<p>Some posts will be technical, some funny, some vulnerable, and some excited, because these are all pieces of my self. I look forward to looking back on years-old posts, and reminiscing where I was on my path at a given time. I already enjoy doing this with personal journal entries, but I have a sense that there will be a unique quality to reflecting on the progression of my blog.</p>
<p>I am also eager for serendipitous moments when someone encounters one of these pieces of my self, and is so compelled by it that they take time to discuss it with me. Positive or negative, if someone is engaging with one of these pieces of my self then it must have struck a chord, and I think that is a decent signal that I am approximating Truth, which is one of my ultimate aims of this blog. To be truth-seeking in my self and truth-seeking in my interests.</p>
<p>I already felt this a bit with my recent post on <a href="https://weidok.al/2024/02/15/i-use-my.html">My Obsidian Daily Note Template</a>. I was astounded by how quickly people were adopting parts of it or all of it. As I published it I thought, &ldquo;Is this too &lsquo;in the weeds&rsquo;? Did I waste my time going into all this detail?&rdquo;. But there were people out there, quite a few, looking for someone to guide them through these particular weeds. It is a wonderful feeling to create a point of connection. Something you and another can both behold and say, &ldquo;This resonates&rdquo;.</p>
<p>So this, too, is one piece among others. If it resonates, I would love to hear from you.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been trying out the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/recommended_routine/">recommended_routine - bodyweightfitness (reddit.com)</a> for exercise. <a href="https://weidok.al/2024/01/19/i-just-finished.html">I got my equipment installed</a>, now I just need to use it consistently. I am really liking the emphasis on stretching and flexibility. I feel great after these workouts.</p>

<h1 id="overview">Overview</h1>
<p>My template allows me to have the same daily note created for me each day. Here&rsquo;s what it looks like:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I&rsquo;ll talk more about each individual section later in this post, but overall this daily note has helped me to become more organized and focused. Its primary purpose is managing tasks and rapidly logging notes throughout the day. Having one place to collect both tasks and quick notes has been helpful for me. A nice perk of doing it in Obsidian is that those quick notes can easily evolve into standalone markdown files if they need to, but the key is having a really <em>low friction</em> place to capture a thought or task.</p>
<p>Having my daily note link to other &ldquo;periodic&rdquo; notes (daily, weekly, monthly) feels very Obsidian-ish, but truth be told I don&rsquo;t use the links too often. They are nice when I need them though, like quickly needing to get to something I logged yesterday.</p>
<p>I used to use the 5 Minute Journal section more than I do now, but this has been replaced by analog journaling. I sort of miss having this stored digitally, and I&rsquo;m sure I could hack together some awesome digital journal dashboard with Dataview, but that&rsquo;s not really the point, is it? Journaling analog helps me to slow down and really reflect, which seems to make my individual sessions more meaningful. And that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m really looking for. All that being said, I do still like using the 5-Minute Journal occasionally when I&rsquo;m feeling scattered and need a quick dose of mindfulness while at my computer.</p>
<p>The Today&rsquo;s Notes section is another one I don&rsquo;t use too often, but it&rsquo;s fun to have. I&rsquo;m not using it to navigate between notes I&rsquo;m currently working on that day, because Obsidian has great navigation features I&rsquo;m using instead (e.g., tabs, search). But I do like having it whenever I take a look at past daily notes. It&rsquo;s fun to see a snapshot of what I worked on any given day, and the combination of the daily log, completed tasks, and Today&rsquo;s Notes paints a nice picture of what I was doing and thinking.</p>
<h1 id="plugins">Plugins</h1>
<h2 id="daily-notes-and-periodic-notes">Daily Notes and Periodic Notes</h2>
<p>These plugins both can create a daily note from a specified template file. Periodic Notes allows the creation of some additional types of notes, like weekly, monthly, quarterly, and yearly.</p>
<p>I prefer to keep my daily notes in their own folder, and each daily note&rsquo;s title is formatted as <code>YYYY-MM-DD</code>.</p>
<p>I keep my template file in &ldquo;Bins/Templates/Daily Note&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s my config for Daily Notes:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Here&rsquo;s my config for Periodic Notes (you&rsquo;ll see I also use weekly and monthly notes, which I link to from my daily note):</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2 id="templater">Templater</h2>
<p>With Templater, if I create a file from a template, either manually or through Daily Notes or Periodic Notes, I can run some code from my template <em>when the template is instantiated</em>. This allows me to get things like the current date, daily quote, date ranges for tasks, and file title at the time when I use the template.</p>
<p>You can even use Templater to run your own JavaScript during note creation, but I am not using that in the current iteration of my daily notes template.</p>
<p>Here is my current config for Templater:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The two important parts are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Specify a template folder (I use &ldquo;Bins/Templates&rdquo;)</li>
<li>Trigger Templater on new file creation. You want this on so that Templater works with Daily Notes and Periodic Notes.</li>
</ol>
<p>I use Templater all over my daily note template, and anything between <code>&lt;% ... %&gt;</code> is Templater syntax.</p>
<h2 id="dataview">Dataview</h2>
<p>Dataview is a powerful way to query data across all of your notes in your Obsidian vault. For my daily note, I use it to display any notes I created or modified that day.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe I did anything unique with the config for Dataview, much of the setup is for viewing preference.</p>
<h2 id="tasks">Tasks</h2>
<p>Obsidian is the main place I track tasks digitally, and I use the Tasks plugin to do that. My full setup with Tasks warrants a separate post, but for my daily note I use it to capture tasks in my Daily Log and to display tasks that are:</p>
<ul>
<li>overdue</li>
<li>due today</li>
<li>coming soon (next 3 days)</li>
<li>completed today</li>
</ul>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t changed much from the default Tasks config. I just have it configured to add a &ldquo;done date&rdquo; each time I complete a task.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2 id="quickadd">QuickAdd</h2>
<p>QuickAdd allows running macros from anywhere in Obsidian. I have a macro setup that can be run from anywhere and allows me to quickly write up text that gets appended at the top of my Daily Log with the current timestamp.</p>
<p>To configure this I created a macro called &ldquo;Capture to daily note&rdquo; in QuickAdd:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In the settings for that macro, I tell it where to add the text, and how to create the Daily Note if it has not already been created:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>To summarize, QuickAdd looks for today&rsquo;s daily note, and then inserts my supplied text after the header I supplied, which is <code>## Daily Log</code>, and gives it some special formatting that I specify near the bottom of the settings. More on this in the Daily Log Section.</p>
<h2 id="buttons">Buttons</h2>
<p>Buttons allows you to place buttons in your notes that can run macros. I use a button in my daily note templated to run the QuickAdd macro I described above. This allows me to really quickly capture a short note to my daily log, even if I am viewing my Daily Note on reading mode (which is something I end up doing often from mobile).</p>
<h2 id="calendar">Calendar</h2>
<p>I use the calendar plugin to navigate between my daily and weekly notes, and to create them.</p>
<h1 id="the-template">The Template</h1>
<p>You can get the full template from this <a href="https://gist.github.com/jakeweidokal/027072dc75ddc77ec9595739808db592">Gist on Github</a>. Below I&rsquo;ll break down the template by section so you can take only the pieces and parts you need.</p>

<ul>
<li>Templater</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>For my habits section, I use the YAML frontmatter of the markdown file to track any daily habits. I use Templater to get the week number and save it as a property. I also use the Frontmatter to tag all daily notes with the <code>#daily</code> tag.  After that, all additional front matter fields are used to track daily metrics, which could be things like weight, times, mood, etc.</p>
<p>To be honest, I don&rsquo;t use this much anymore, but it was useful when I was doing intermittent fasting. I was eating within an 8 hour window each day, so I used this section to track when I started eating, when I stopped eating, and my weight. Then, with this data stored in each daily note, I used the Obsidian Charts plugin in my weekly and monthly notes to trend my progress over time. If you are interested in how this is setup, shoot me an email and let me know.</p>

<p>All my daily notes have a file title in the format <code>YYYY-MM-DD</code>, but I like having a more readable format that includes the weekday.</p>
<p>I use the <code>tp.date.now</code> function to format the date from the title of the file. Here are what the 4 different parameters in the function do:</p>
<ol>
<li>Format - sets the format for the date</li>
<li>Offset - I keep this at 0 because I want the current date. 1 would give me tomorrow, -1 would give me yesterday.</li>
<li>Reference - the date to use. If not provided, the function uses today&rsquo;s date when a note is created from it. I supply the file title here so that no matter <em>when</em> I make my daily note, the title in the note matches the file title. For example, I might create tomorrow&rsquo;s daily note ahead of time to start taking notes for tomorrow, so I want the file title to be the date used, NOT today&rsquo;s date during note creation.</li>
<li>Reference format - the date format for #3</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="description-4">Description</h3>
<p>I like having a Daily Log section to rapid log tasks, ideas, notes, etc. throughout the day. I added a button to help me do this for two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>I use Obsidian mobile, and often view notes in reading mode from my phone. Having the button allows me to quickly capture a log even from reading mode</li>
<li>I like having a timestamp for my log entries. It forces a chronological log I can look back on.</li>
</ol>
<p>I described how I configured the QuickAdd macro above in the <a href="#quickadd">QuickAdd Plugin section</a>. Once the QuickAdd macro is configured, I can add the Button to my template and use the <code>command</code> type to call my QuickAdd macro.</p>
<p>I do often add things to my daily note without using the &ldquo;Add to Log&rdquo; button. This section is where I create and store my tasks 97% of the time. That way, my task location is the daily note, so I can easily see the date it was created and I get the associated context of everything else stored in my daily note.</p>

<h4 id="setting-up-css-snippets-for-callout-styles">Setting Up CSS Snippets for Callout Styles</h4>
<p>Before I get into the task queries for the template, I&rsquo;ll mention that I use callouts to contain my task queries because I like the color-coded separation, and I like being able to collapse/expand my task lists. I have set up custom callout styles that I&rsquo;ve tailored to my task system. The default styles would work fine too, but you can set up custom styles with CSS Snippets.</p>
<p>I followed the docs <a href="https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Callouts#Customize+callouts">here</a> to get this set up.</p>
<p>Under &ldquo;Appearance &gt; CSS Snippets&rdquo;, click the folder icon to open your snippets folder (.obsidian/snippets).</p>
<p>In this location, create a file called callouts.css that contains the following:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>.callout[data-callout=&quot;overdue&quot;] {
  --callout-color: 255, 215, 0;
  --callout-icon: alarm-clock;
}

.callout[data-callout=&quot;due-today&quot;] {
  --callout-color: 12, 248, 161;
  --callout-icon: check-square;
}

.callout[data-callout=&quot;coming-soon&quot;] {
  --callout-color: 37, 202, 227;
  --callout-icon: timer;
}

.callout[data-callout=&quot;next-two-weeks&quot;] {
  --callout-color: 42, 165, 227;
  --callout-icon: hourglass;
}

.callout[data-callout=&quot;later&quot;] {
  --callout-color: 127, 128, 222;
  --callout-icon: calendar;
}

.callout[data-callout=&quot;no-date&quot;] {
  --callout-color: 163, 80, 250;
  --callout-icon: calendar-off;
}

.callout[data-callout=&quot;recurring&quot;] {
  --callout-color: 216, 191, 216;
  --callout-icon: repeat;
}

.callout[data-callout=&quot;personal&quot;] {
  --callout-color: 240, 240, 240;
  --callout-icon: user;
}

.callout[data-callout=&quot;work&quot;] {
  --callout-color: 240, 240, 240;
  --callout-icon: briefcase;
}
</code></pre><p>Go back to &ldquo;Appearance &gt; CSS Snippets&rdquo; and click the refresh icon to reload the snippets into Obsidian&rsquo;s styles.</p>
<p>Now you can use these callout type identifiers to style your callouts. These are the custom callout types I use to contain different types of tasks. I don&rsquo;t use all of these in my daily note, some show up in other places like my Tasks Dashboard.</p>
<h4 id="grouping-tasks">Grouping Tasks</h4>
<p>For my daily note, I like my task queries to show tasks in a certain date range (e.g., overdue, due today, due in the next 3 days, completed today) and then within the query, I like to group my tasks by whether they are related to work, personal, or uncategorized. I use tags to assign my tasks to projects, so I look at the tag to determine which group a task should fall into.</p>
<p>My tag structure for organizing tasks has three sections: <code>#{prefix}/{area}/{project}</code>. An example tag would be: <code>#p/personal/website</code>. I prefix all project tags with <code>p/</code> so that I can quickly pull them all up in the typeahead menu when I start typing a tag. The second part of the tag is the area that the project belongs to, which is either &ldquo;work&rdquo; or &ldquo;personal&rdquo; in my setup. This is what I like to group my tasks on.</p>
<p>To accomplish this, at the end of my tasks query I have:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>group by function task.tags.map( (tag) =&gt; tag.split('/')[1] ? tag.split('/').slice(0, 2).join('/') : '')
</code></pre><p>Here&rsquo;s what this is doing for each task:</p>
<ul>
<li>it looks to see, &ldquo;Does this task have a tag with an area section?&rdquo;</li>
<li>if it does, it cuts off the project from the end, and returns the area like: <code>#{prefix}/{area}</code></li>
<li>if it does not, it returns empty</li>
</ul>
<p>So then my tasks fall into one of 3 groups:</p>
<ol>
<li>Personal</li>
<li>Work</li>
<li>Uncategorized</li>
</ol>
<p>My &ldquo;due soon&rdquo; tasks query takes grouping even further, and groups tasks first by their due date and then sub-groups into the areas I defined above.</p>

<p>My &ldquo;Today&rsquo;s Notes&rdquo; section lists any notes I created or modified during the day that the current daily note represents. I like being able to trace this history where I can go back to a daily note and see what I was working on in Obsidian that day.</p>
<p>The logic for Created Today is show files that:</p>
<ul>
<li>were created on or after today at 12AM</li>
<li>were created on or before tomorrow at 12AM</li>
<li>except for this daily note</li>
</ul>
<p>The logic for Modified Today is show files that:</p>
<ul>
<li>were modified on or after today at 12AM</li>
<li>were modified on or before tomorrow at 12AM</li>
<li>except for this daily note</li>
</ul>

<p>I hope this helps you with setting up your own Daily Note template! I took inspiration from many places to put this together, and I hope to give back to the Obsidian community by sharing how I use my Daily Note. It is where I spend at least 80% of my time in Obsidian.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://www.esv.org/Proverbs+31/">Proverbs 31/31</a> Advice to King Lemuel from his mother: Don&rsquo;t spend your time pursuing women; this has brought down many kings. Kings should not get drunk so they do not tear down what they created while sober. Speak for those who do not have a voice. Judge justly and defend the rights of the poor. A wonderful spouse is rare. They can be trusted and have a good work ethic. Always they provide for their family and plan for their future. They are confident and strong. They help the poor and are not afraid of hard times for which they have prepared. From their mouth flows wisdom and kindness. They are praised by their children and their spouses. Charm and beauty are fleeting, but a spouse who reveres God is praiseworthy. They will get back more than they have put in.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p><a href="https://www.esv.org/Proverbs+30/">Proverbs 30/31</a> God&rsquo;s word is true; don&rsquo;t add to it. Stay away from lying and fakeness. Don&rsquo;t become rich and forget who God is. Don&rsquo;t become poor and steal, disrespecting God. Some think themselves clean while covered in filth. Greed is never content; give, and it wants more. If you mock your father, mother, and all authority, there will be consequences. Being suddenly put in a situation for which one is deeply unqualified will lead to disaster. Even small things can be wise; ants, groundhogs, locusts, lizards. The beloved leader walks with the confidence of the lion. If you have been foolish or planning to do evil, restrain yourself. Pressing anger produces strife.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p><a href="https://www.esv.org/Proverbs+29/">Proverbs 29/31</a> Those that are stiff and inflexible will be broken. With justice, a nation is built, but greed tears one down. The good understand the rights of the poor. A fool indulges every passion of their spirit, but one with wisdom quietly holds themself back. The proud will be brought low, and the humble will be raised in honor. Fear is a cage, but one who trusts God is free. We look to judges for justice, but it can only truly be given by God. Good and evil appear as an abomination to one another.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://www.esv.org/Proverbs+28/">Proverbs 28/31</a> The evil live constantly in fear, but the good live confidently. It is better to be poor and honest than rich and crooked. Be generous to the poor. A rich one thinks themself wise, but is bested by a poor one with understanding. There is glory when good prevails, but people hide when evil rises. One that hides their sins will not prosper, but one that owns up to them and turns away will receive mercy. An unwise leader oppresses cruelly, but one who hates unjust gain will prolong their time. The faithful one abounds with blessings, but one who cheats for their own gain will be punished. Whoever puts their faith in their mind is a fool, but those that walk in wisdom will do well.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p><a href="https://www.esv.org/Proverbs+27/">Proverbs 27/31</a> Don&rsquo;t brag about your future, it is not guaranteed. Praise from one&rsquo;s own mouth is not valid; let it come from another. Be cautious of anger and jealousy; it is difficult to stand against them. True love includes rebuke when needed. An enemy can feign love with kind words. Everything tastes good to one who is hungry. The goodness of a friend comes from their authentic advice. A close neighbor is better than a far brother. When and where you act is just as important as how. Friends sharpen each other like iron on iron. As gold is refined in the furnace, one is tested by their praise. Pay attention to what you have; your possessions do not watch themselves and will not last on their own.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p><a href="https://www.esv.org/Proverbs+26/">Proverbs 26/31</a> Honor does not fit a fool. Don&rsquo;t answer a fool in their style, but correct their mistakes. A proverb coming from a fool is useless. Fools return to their ways like dogs to their vomit. There is more hope for a fool than one who thinks themselves wise. Do not meddle in other people&rsquo;s fights. Fire dies without wood, and strife dies without a gossiper. One who displays hate hides deceit in their heart; do not trust them when they aim kind words your way. Those who lay traps will fall into them.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://www.esv.org/Proverbs+25/">Proverbs 25/31</a> God, knowing all, conceals. We, knowing little, seek truth. Don&rsquo;t force yourself into high places, it is better to be invited from a lowly place than to be put down in a high place. Don&rsquo;t share other&rsquo;s secrets. Patient and persuasive words may change the course of nations. Take even good things in moderation. Don&rsquo;t be overly joyful in the presence of those with a heavy heart. Provide for your enemy, this is a greater victory than battle. Like a clogged sprinkler is a good one who allows evil. One without self-control is like a house that has been broken into and left open.</p>

Don&rsquo;t take what isn&rsquo;t yours. Don&rsquo;t stop a child from being disciplined, it will not kill them. On the contrary, it will save them from death. Don&rsquo;t envy sinners, go on in reverence and trust there is a future. Don&rsquo;t befriend drunks or gluttons, they will come to ruin and take you with them. Buy truth and don&rsquo;t sell it for anything. Stay away from a flirt, they increase the traitors among mankind.

Justice is joy to the righteous and terror to the evil. One who loves pleasure and luxury will be poor. The wise preserve their treasures, but fools devour theirs. Pursue righteousness, and you will find it, along with life and honor. Control your speech to stay out of trouble. The wicked act boldly, but the upright openly consider their ways.</p>

Be careful offering bribes, lest you come to depend on them. It is loving to forgive, you will lose friends if you rehash old wounds. A reprimand to the wise penetrates further than a beating to a fool. Friends love through highs and lows. Joy is good medicine, but a crushed spirit is crippling.

You will discover good things if you ponder the word. Gracious words are sweet to the soul. One&rsquo;s appetite urges them on. A whisperer separates close friends.

(Lettuce + Love) &gt; (Filet Mignon + Hatred). The path is easy for the upright, but for the idle, it is like walking through thorns. Plans fail without counsel, but with many advisors, they succeed. The Lord destroys the house of the arrogant but protects the house of the humble. He who hates bribes will live. The heart of the righteous ponders, but the mouth of the wicked pours out. Reverence for God is instruction in wisdom. Humility comes before honor.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://www.esv.org/Proverbs+14/">Proverbs 14/31</a> The upright reveres the Lord, the evil despises him. Things are easy without work, but there will be nothing to harvest. A cynic seeks wisdom in vain, but it comes easy for one of understanding. Run from fools. Fools mock those who seek forgiveness, but the upright find it. No one knows your heart like you. Life is both joy and grief, together. The wise are cautious, but fools are reckless. Blessed are those generous to the poor. A ruler is only as good as their people. Be slow to anger. Envy will rot your core.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://www.esv.org/Proverbs+13/">Proverbs 13/31</a> The one who watches their words saves their life, but the one who speaks without thinking will be ruined. The poor one is not threatened by ransoms for their life. Insolent = strife, receptive = wisdom. Quick riches dwindle, gather little by little to increase. Prudent ones act with knowledge, but fools flaunt their folly. If disaster pursues you, consider living righteously. One who walks with the wise becomes wise, but a friend of fools hurts themselves. To discipline is to love. The righteous are satisfied, the wicked want.</p>

A fool is right in his own eyes, but the wise listens to advice. The wise ignore insults, but a fool is clear about their rage. The words of the fool damage, the words of the wise heal.

Beauty without discretion is like a pearl in a pile of crap. One who gives grows richer, one who withholds giving suffers want. Do not put faith in your riches.</p>

			 <p>Below are some thoughts I typed up the morning before my wife was induced for our first child. I recall feeling especially reflective that morning, and I was trying to prepare myself for what was ahead (note: I was/am still unprepared, but I&rsquo;ve managed to figure things out on the fly so far).</p>
<h1 id="2023-07-05-thoughts-on-the-day-of-the-induction">2023-07-05 Thoughts on the Day of the Induction</h1>
<p>Soon I am going to be a dad and my wife is going to be a mom. It is strange how major change can be right in front of my face, and yet it is hard to believe that it is coming. But how will things change? How can I know what change will be like before it has made its way into my life and started to rearrange things I once cared for? Will I be sad at losing things? Certain freedoms? Or will my values and beliefs be changed?</p>
<p>It feels more like the latter, but I have no idea how that will play out. I think I will miss some freedoms from before having a baby, like getting sleep whenever I want, but on the whole, I think this will be a good change and I am really looking forward to it.</p>
<p>Here is what I think <em>will change</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Less sleep, especially early on</li>
<li>I will develop a larger capacity for love</li>
<li>If I do it right, I will slow down and see the world through a child&rsquo;s eyes once again</li>
<li>Life will become less flexible in some ways - not able to disc golf as much, trickier to go into the office for work, etc.</li>
<li>My wife and I will need to unite around a common goal in a way that we really haven&rsquo;t had to before</li>
<li>Less time to myself</li>
<li>More laughter</li>
<li>Really more of all emotions. I think life will become more vivid and intense, as long as I lean in</li>
<li>More walks (I am really excited to use the fancy stroller we got 😂)</li>
<li>Less of an aversion to grossness. Getting accustomed to changing dirty diapers and getting poo/pee on myself</li>
<li>More wonder and awe</li>
<li>More prioritizing family. It is easy to dive into work and get consumed with projects I am working on, but I think it will become easier/more important to be giving myself to my family</li>
<li>Less self-centeredness</li>
<li>Less screen time (This will not magically change on its own, but I will be focusing on this. I do NOT want to be the dad that has his face in his phone while his daughter is wanting to be seen by him.)</li>
<li>My WHY will be strengthened. I will have more purpose and conviction behind my actions.</li>
<li>The burden of responsibility on my shoulders will be increased</li>
</ul>
<p>Someday when my daughter describes her dad <em>I hope she will say</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>He loved me</li>
<li>We had so much fun together</li>
<li>He was goofy and embarrassed me in school</li>
<li>He was my example for following Jesus</li>
<li>He showed me how a good man should treat me</li>
<li>He could beat up all the other dads 😂</li>
<li>He was there when I needed a shoulder to cry on</li>
<li>He got out of his comfort zone to try things I wanted to do</li>
<li>He didn&rsquo;t raise his voice at me unless he had to keep me safe</li>
<li>He loved mom</li>
<li>He encouraged my interests</li>
<li>He taught me right from wrong</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="reflections">Reflections</h1>
<p>Now that I my daughter is over 5 months old, I&rsquo;m impressed with my past self that most of his predictions were pretty close. I&rsquo;d like to reflect on some of what I got right/wrong.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Will I be sad at losing things? Certain freedoms? Or will my values and beliefs be changed?</p>
<p>It feels more like the latter, but I have no idea how that will play out.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have found it to be true that my values have shifted some. It was not such a big and dramatic immediate change as I had expected, but I have not felt sad about losing any freedoms from before my daughter was born.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I will develop a larger capacity for love</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if my capacity for love is larger or not, but close moments with her do hit differently. Baby giggles or moments when it is just the two of us looking into each other&rsquo;s eyes make my heart so full.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If I do it right, I will slow down and see the world through a child&rsquo;s eyes once again</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am still working on this, and I want to do this more. I think I will be forced into this soon, as she will begin crawling in the next couple of months, so I&rsquo;m going to need to put my baby cap on to identify all the hazards we may still have on the floors.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My wife and I will need to unite around a common goal in a way that we really haven&rsquo;t had to before</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes. Having a baby has been very uniting, but also brings about a number of disagreements over strongly held opinions on parenting. So far, we have centered around &ldquo;safety&rdquo; as our tiebreaker to determine which opinion we should go with when we can&rsquo;t come to agreement through talking about it. It is interesting that so many of our opinions are rooted in our own childhood experiences, so in a lot of our disagreements it is more important to empathize with each other about past experiences than to rationalize about the current situation. When we empathize, we both tend to feel much better about the approach we decide on. The core to all of this is a mutual understanding that we are on the same team, and we both want the best for our daughter, even when we are coming at it from different angles.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Less time to myself</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finding time for <em>me</em> has become much more challenging. The only alone time I&rsquo;ve found has come early in the morning, before the girls are awake. Surprisingly though, changing diapers in the middle of the night has made it <em>easier</em> to get up early. It has been very refreshing for me to get up around 4:30 or 5:00, make a warm cup of coffee, and then either journal, read a book, or work on a personal project. I&rsquo;d like to incorporate more exercise into my &ldquo;me time&rdquo;, but the time feels so short and I&rsquo;m having way more fun doing stuff like writing this post. I know I will feel so much better if I just suck it up and do the exercise though, and I can find ways to be fast and still have time for the other things I enjoy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Really more of all emotions. I think life will become more vivid and intense, as long as I lean in</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When I can keep myself free from attention-grabbing distractions (looking at you, phone) and I can focus my whole being on time with my family, this is true. I have found that I am still just as prone toward distraction though, and while I get distracted with flashy colors and noises (YouTube), the color in front of my eyes slowly sucks the color out of life around me. I feel grayer and duller when I am giving into distractions. It is sad that this numbing has become the norm in our society, with so many of us getting off of work and going straight to TV, phone, video games, you name it. I think my disclaimer &ldquo;as long as I lean in&rdquo;, holds true here. I need to constantly check in with myself to be sure that I am leaning in.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>More walks (I am really excited to use the fancy stroller we got 😂)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This has saved me from my lack of a workout routine. What I didn&rsquo;t account for, though, was how much I&rsquo;d be walking around the house carrying the baby. That is a workout in itself! I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve gained strength in my upper body, but my endurance is way higher now that I am carrying a baby all the time.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>More prioritizing family. It is easy to dive into work and get consumed with projects I am working on, but I think it will become easier/more important to be giving myself to my family</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This has not come automatically. I&rsquo;ve tried to do this, but I have to really work for it. Work issues can seem so urgent, and personal projects can feel so much more fun than changing diapers. I must patiently remind myself of the value of being with my family when other things are constantly pulling at me. This value is realized on a scale of years, or even decades, when my family will be able to look back and see how much I loved them, even in the little moments. This perspective is hard to have when so many other things feel like they need my attention NOW and I could see results on them right away.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The burden of responsibility on my shoulders will be increased</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This sounds so serious and heavy lol. Yes this is true, but I haven&rsquo;t felt weighed down at all.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Someday when my daughter describes her dad <em>I hope she will say</em>:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I won&rsquo;t be able to reflect on the real-life outcomes of this section for another 20+ years. But all of these hopes are still true. I was emotional as I wrote it originally, and I am emotional again thinking about this. It really all boils down to: <em>I hope she feels loved by me, and I hope she reciprocates it</em>. It feels scary to think that one or both of these could not be true in 20+ years. But I get emotional thinking about how joyful I will be if both are true.</p>
<p>All in all, being a dad has been awesome. I would do it again, but not anytime too soon. Right now I am perfectly content with just having one daughter and learning how to love her well.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve never considered my handwriting to be great, but I&rsquo;ve been doing a lot more writing by hand recently so I resolved to make an effort to write more legibly.</p>
<p>The first thing I tried was to add more space between each character and each word, and that alone made a huge difference! Actually, it&rsquo;s enough of an improvement that I&rsquo;m content with my handwriting for now and won&rsquo;t be trying any more improvements for a while. Keeping some level of messiness feels necessary to maintain the <em>soul</em> of my style.</p>
<p>Focusing on pushing my hand out to the right to separate each character has made my writing feel like it flows a lot better. I think before I was overly focused on cramming each word tightly together so I could maximize the space on each page. In fact, since making this change, part of me still feels guilty for taking up more space on the page with each word. Somehow it feels wasteful, and I&rsquo;m surprised I could feel guilty about something so trivial. I try to remind myself that whitespace has value too. It brings separation, clarity. It lays the canvas from which each character or word is defined. Having too much ink smushed together muddles everything up. Each stroke is only as good as the accompanying whitespace that makes it a stroke at all.</p>
<p>As I think about whitespace in a literal sense and how it has improved my writing, it makes me wonder about whitespace in a figurative sense. Are there areas in my life where I am trying too hard to cram &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; together, and a little whitespace might bring separation and clarity? What does whitespace even mean, in that sense?</p>

<p>Working at the NASA Safety Center, part of the <a href="https://sma.nasa.gov/">Office of Safety and Mission Assurance</a>. My big focus recently has been product strategy for a new root cause analysis software we are building from scratch. I&rsquo;ve also been making our safety-related data more accessible for analysis, defining how we will leverage Microsoft Power Platform, and improving our dev team&rsquo;s technical capabilities.</p>

<p>My daughter is 5 months old now. I&rsquo;m taking every opportunity I get to play on the floor with her and laugh together. My wife and I are getting back into a regular date-night routine.</p>

<p>Working on this personal website. I&rsquo;ve missed having coding as a regular part of my day, so I&rsquo;m tinkering on this site to remedy that.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve always journaled in some capacity, but I&rsquo;ve really gotten back into it recently. I&rsquo;m bullet journaling daily, partially to track personal to-dos, partially to log what is happening each day, but mostly to force myself to review what is happening each month and each day. The slowness of the practice helps me retain my schedule better in my brain. I&rsquo;m also doing morning pages most mornings to declutter my mind at the start of each day. As part of this renewed interest in journaling, I&rsquo;ve gotten back into fountain pens. Right now, I&rsquo;m using a <a href="https://a.co/d/elJ2Eby">Lamy Safari</a> with <a href="https://a.co/d/8rP2yg2">Diamine Red Dragon</a> ink.</p>

<p>Working on eating smaller portion sizes and wishing I worked out more 😂 I&rsquo;ve been doing random sets of pushups every now and then, but I plan to start following the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/recommended_routine/">Recommended Routine</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/">Reddit&rsquo;s Bodyweight Fitness Community</a></p>
