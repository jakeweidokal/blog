<p>&ldquo;They see they can and must stand up, because they begin to understand how genuinely monstrous they will become, otherwise, feeding on their resentment, transforming it into the most destructive of wishes. To say it again: There is very little difference between the capacity for mayhem and destruction, integrated, and strength of character. This is one of the most difficult lessons of life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>- <a href="https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/">Jordan B. Peterson</a>, <a href="https://a.co/d/5q4bKF2">12 Rules for Life</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To be good, you must be dangerous.</p>
<p>Much of my life, I equated dangerous with bad. But I have come to realize that a chief aim of the good ought to be to increase their dangerousness. This is necessary when operating in and around evil.</p>
<p>A capacity for evil is not inherently bad. Your capacity is morally neutral, but it is up to you to wield it appropriately. C.S. Lewis illustrates this well when answering the question of why there is evil at all:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;‘Why did God make a creature of such rotten stuff that it went wrong?’ The better stuff a creature is made of—the cleverer and stronger and freer it is—then the better it will be if it goes right, but also the worse it will be if it goes wrong. A cow cannot be very good or very bad; a dog can be both better and worse; a child better and worse still; an ordinary man, still more so; a man of genius, still more so; a superhuman spirit best—or worst—of all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>- <a href="https://www.cslewis.com/us/">C.S. Lewis</a>, <a href="https://a.co/d/eLUvhU1">Mere Christianity</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jesus makes this point too, when telling his disciples that they ought to be wise as serpents. This is potent imagery considering it was a serpent that caused the fall of man.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Behold, I am sending you out as sheep in the midst of wolves, so be wise as serpents and innocent as doves.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2010%3A16&amp;version=ESV">Matthew 10:16 ESV</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>He implores them to wield the wisdom of the serpent with the innocence of the dove. Why not just tell them to be innocent as doves? Because to be good, you must be dangerous.</p>
<p>This then, is the aim of the good: to be cleverer and stronger and freer. To be dangerous.</p>

			 <p>Below is the template I created for writing user stories.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code># User Story

As a...  
I want...  
So that...  

# Description

Lorem...

# Acceptance Criteria

- bullet criteria

GIVEN setup  
WHEN action  
THEN result  
</code></pre><p>I write a lot of user stories for my team, and they need to be clear, to the point, and verifiable. This template was born out of a need for consistency in how user stories were defined and written and aims to give a development team the bare minimum they need to deliver a hot, fresh slice of valuable software. Nothing here is ground-breaking, but it serves as a foundation for defining work when building software.</p>
<h1 id="user-story-statement-section">User Story Statement Section</h1>
<p>First, we start with the traditional user story statement.</p>
<p>As a<br>
I want<br>
So that</p>
<p>This forces the author of the story to be clear about who wants what, and most importantly, <em>why</em> they want it.</p>
<p>For the <code>As a</code> clause, try to be clear about a specific type of person. If your description can conjure up a mental picture of a distinct archetypal user-type, you&rsquo;re doing it right. Avoid writing simply <code>As a user</code> at all costs. We&rsquo;ve all done it, and we should all be ashamed.</p>
<p>In your <code>I want</code> section, describe <strong>one</strong> want. If you are tempted to have more than one clause here, you might consider if an additional user story is warranted.</p>
<p>With the <code>So that</code> clause, focus intently on the unique value this will provide to your archetypal user-type. This is the hardest clause to write, but also the most important to do well. It&rsquo;s value may be obscure to some, because it does not directly contribute to the &ldquo;spec&rdquo; of what needs built. But this is your chance to clearly define the impact of this work to be done. It breathes life into the code to be written, and gives your designer, developer, tester, etc. a clear reason for doing what they&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<h1 id="description-section">Description Section</h1>
<p>This is your chance to go into more detail about your user story. What should the user-facing phrasing be? What data are we working with?</p>
<p>I often will take a first pass at this providing as much important context and detail as I can from the product perspective. Sometimes, a developer will go into description after I&rsquo;ve written it and add a subsection for <code>Technical Details</code> to go more in depth on any technical nuances to the user story that should be considered during development and testing.</p>
<h1 id="acceptance-criteria-section">Acceptance Criteria Section</h1>
<p>Acceptance criteria gives the team a clear basis to know when they are done with a user story. It is something we can point to and either say &ldquo;Yes, we accomplished what we wanted to&rdquo; or &ldquo;No, this doesn&rsquo;t do everything we needed&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I write acceptance criteria one of two ways, and sometimes I use both.</p>
<h2 id="bullet-syntax">Bullet Syntax</h2>
<p>Acceptance criteria can be a simple bullet-list. This is more often the case for smaller user stories, or ones that are more technical. This can be a simple, useful tool to include any non-functional requirements that need to be met to accept the user story.</p>
<h2 id="gherkin-syntax">Gherkin Syntax</h2>
<p>When it makes sense, I write acceptance criteria in GIVEN, WHEN, THEN format. This lays out a very clear path for manually testing the user story, and this syntax can be used for behavior driven development. It becomes an executable spec that we can use directly in our automated tests.</p>
<h1 id="example">Example</h1>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an example of a user story I&rsquo;ve written recently:</p>
<blockquote>
<h1 id="user-story">User Story</h1>
<p><strong>As a</strong> case owner or admin<br>
<strong>I want</strong> to add users to my case<br>
<strong>So that</strong> I can collaborate with others<br>
<strong>And</strong> determine appropriate access levels for CRUD operations</p>
<h1 id="description">Description</h1>
<p>link to mockups</p>
<p>The scope of this ticket includes setting up roles in the application. See the roles matrix for the case-specific roles in the application.</p>
<p>Add a button in the top right to add case members (see mockups, only visible for case owners and admins).</p>
<p>Owners and admins can add other members. The owner can add Admins, but Admins cannot add other Admins.</p>
<p>After clicking the button, the user selects a person and a role, and then can save them as a member to the case. After saving, the new member should be displayed in the case members table.</p>
<p>The role options will be&hellip;</p>
<ul>
<li>Case Roles
<ul>
<li><strong>Admin</strong> (CRUD, only visible to case owner)</li>
<li><strong>Contributor</strong> (CRU, D data they created. Can remove items from diagram)</li>
<li><strong>Report Editor</strong> (R, U report section)</li>
<li><strong>View Only</strong> (R)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that &ldquo;Owner&rdquo; is not one of the role options, because the owner is whoever created the case and there will only ever be one owner per case.</p>
<h1 id="acceptance-criteria">Acceptance Criteria</h1>
<p><strong>GIVEN</strong> I am a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(owner, case admin)<br>
<strong>WHEN</strong> I add a member as a contributor<br>
<strong>THEN</strong> the member is displayed in the case members table with the contributor role</p>
<p><strong>GIVEN</strong> I am a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(contributor, report editor, view only)<br>
<strong>THEN</strong> I do not see the button to add a member</p>
<p><strong>GIVEN</strong> I am &ldquo;case admin&rdquo;<br>
<strong>WHEN</strong> I am selecting the role for a new member<br>
<strong>THEN</strong> I can not select &ldquo;case admin&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While this template helps define the user story, it is important to remember that the user story is a placeholder for conversation. If you write this up and then immediately push it to your team to work on it, you&rsquo;re missing the beauty of the user story. Bring your draft of the user story before the team and then have a conversation about it. Invite ideas and questions from others on the team. Define and come to a common understanding of the problem to be solved, or the value to be delivered. Then determine how you will bring forth that solution or value.</p>

			 <p>I added a <a href="/blogroll">blogroll</a> to my site! I had been thinking about creating this for a while, and the new <a href="https://help.micro.blog/t/recommendations/2671">recommendations</a> feature in Micro.blog gave me the push to finally do it. I added it to my navigation links, but&hellip; it&rsquo;s getting really crowded up there. I may have to do something about that, but I want people to be able to find my blogroll, and putting a link in any of my other pages didn&rsquo;t seem quite right.</p>
<p>For now, it is just a list of sites, but I&rsquo;d like to add little one-liner descriptions of why I like each site. I&rsquo;ve had a lot of fun discovering blogs through the blogrolls of others, and I&rsquo;m excited to start to share my own recommendations! My list will grow as I discover new blogs. Right now I&rsquo;ve been finding a lot of interesting blogs by clicking around at <a href="https://blogroll.org/">https://blogroll.org/</a> and <a href="https://ooh.directory/">https://ooh.directory/</a>. These are awesome resources to find independent folks sharing from their own space on the web.</p>
<p>My favorite way to discover sites though is through personal recommendations. The more organic, the better. Here&rsquo;s my rank order of favorite ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>A personal 1:1 recommendation - &ldquo;Jake! You gotta check out&hellip;.&rdquo;</li>
<li>A link in a post I&rsquo;m enjoying (falling down a rabbit hole)</li>
<li>A blogroll on a personal site</li>
<li>A blog listing site (like those linked above)</li>
</ol>
<p>If you have some blogs I need to check out or other ways of discovering blogs, I&rsquo;d love to hear about them!</p>

I have an idea for an interactive haiku but I&rsquo;m not positive how that will work since my posts are published in Markdown. It should be a fun mini-project!</p>
<p>To my chagrin, I tend towards rule-following, so most of my haiku will follow the 5-7-5 format. I would like to experiment outside of those lines from time to time.</p>

<p>This is a big reason that I&rsquo;ve been off of social media. The main thing I miss is keeping up with life updates from friends and family. Someone should build an AI that watches my social feeds and sends me a summarized weekly email of my friends' and family&rsquo;s updates.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p><a href="https://weidok.al">My website</a> looked quite different at its beginning. I thought starting a blog would be a good opportunity to play around with new technology, so I decided to teach myself <a href="https://kit.svelte.dev/">SvelteKit</a> and build my site with it. It was very exciting: I would build in SvelteKit, write all my posts as standalone markdown files, and deploy on <a href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a>. As I started building and exploring what other people had done to get inspiration, I came across a concept called the <a href="https://indieweb.org/">IndieWeb</a>. I felt aligned with the values of this web community, so I wanted to build my site to be part of it. Suddenly, my to-do list was expanding rapidly to include all sorts of IndieWeb specs and principles. Would markdown files be enough to do everything I wanted to do? Perhaps I would need to set up a database using something like <a href="https://supabase.com/">Supabase</a>&hellip;</p>
<p>The more I added to my to-do list for the site, the more I began to dread working on it. This was supposed to be fun, what happened?</p>
<p>I lost my Why. What I <em>really</em> wanted was to start writing. To have a place to share myself and to figure out how to do that. That was my Why. But I wasn&rsquo;t clear on that. I thought this site would be a good place to write <em>and</em> be a fun coding project. Mixing those was a mistake for me. I became so consumed with perfecting the design and functionality that I had no time to think about writing.</p>
<p>So what to do? I had this thing that I built, that I actually quite liked, but it was taking me further from my Why rather than toward it.</p>
<p>I decided to tear it all down.</p>
<p>I threw everything away and started from a blank slate. How could I just write? How could I stay connected to my Why? A blogging platform, duh! Other people have already solved the problem of creating a website whose primary purpose is publishing writing. In fact, <a href="https://www.manton.org/">Manton</a> over at <a href="https://micro.blog/">Micro.blog</a> solved that problem <em>and</em> built his solution on the IndieWeb principles I admire, so that was the clear choice for me. I took everything I had written and migrated it over to Micro.blog, abandoning my SvelteKit project.</p>
<p>After the migration, everything felt better. I had space to write, space to bring forth my Why. I still couldn&rsquo;t keep myself from customizing themes and plugins to make the site my own, but a little bit of play is okay as long as it leaves my Why undisturbed.</p>
<p>Why had this not been obvious in the beginning? Well for one, I didn&rsquo;t even know about Micro.blog or the IndieWeb when I started out. But more importantly, my thinking had been clouded by an unclear Why and a fear of judgment, which I&rsquo;ve come to realize are connected. My fear was something like, &ldquo;This is supposed to be a web software guy and he didn&rsquo;t build his own site from scratch? He must not <strong>really</strong> know his stuff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a silly fear. Who cares? Have you seen all the intelligent people working in the web space that host their sites on a platform? They&rsquo;re everywhere! And yet, I could not come to that realization until I was really clear on my Why.</p>
<p>I share all of this to implore you to evaluate your Why. Do you have the right Why? Are you clear on it? Is what you&rsquo;re doing moving you in the right direction? If not, it&rsquo;s very possible that you can make minor course corrections to get you back on track. You should try that first. But if you&rsquo;ve gotten far away from your Why, don&rsquo;t be afraid to tear it all down. It&rsquo;s okay to start at zero. The sunk cost has already sunk, so don&rsquo;t drown yourself trying to save it.</p>
<p>Tearing it all down is not the fastest way to do a thing, but it may be the way to do <em>the right</em> thing.</p>
<hr>
<p>Here are some screenshots of what the site looked like before. I had a v1 for my homepage, which was ripped off from this YouTube video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylCUH6LkW80&amp;ab_channel=Smoljames">Build &amp; Deploy a Modern Web Portfolio w. SvelteKit &amp; TailwindCSS (youtube.com)</a>. That felt fake and not like my own, so I started to simplify it into a v2 before deciding to tear it all down.</p>

<p>I appreciate this reframing of a blog post as a &ldquo;piece of my self&rdquo;. As I set out in the early stages of my blog, this captures quite well what I aspire for it to be. Each post is one tiny piece of me, a snapshot in time of one aspect of my self I thought worth sharing. Brought together as a whole, they tell a scattered story of my wanderings.</p>
<p>Some posts will be technical, some funny, some vulnerable, and some excited, because these are all pieces of my self. I look forward to looking back on years-old posts, and reminiscing where I was on my path at a given time. I already enjoy doing this with personal journal entries, but I have a sense that there will be a unique quality to reflecting on the progression of my blog.</p>
<p>I am also eager for serendipitous moments when someone encounters one of these pieces of my self, and is so compelled by it that they take time to discuss it with me. Positive or negative, if someone is engaging with one of these pieces of my self then it must have struck a chord, and I think that is a decent signal that I am approximating Truth, which is one of my ultimate aims of this blog. To be truth-seeking in my self and truth-seeking in my interests.</p>
<p>I already felt this a bit with my recent post on <a href="https://weidok.al/2024/02/15/i-use-my.html">My Obsidian Daily Note Template</a>. I was astounded by how quickly people were adopting parts of it or all of it. As I published it I thought, &ldquo;Is this too &lsquo;in the weeds&rsquo;? Did I waste my time going into all this detail?&rdquo;. But there were people out there, quite a few, looking for someone to guide them through these particular weeds. It is a wonderful feeling to create a point of connection. Something you and another can both behold and say, &ldquo;This resonates&rdquo;.</p>
<p>So this, too, is one piece among others. If it resonates, I would love to hear from you.</p>

<h1 id="overview">Overview</h1>
<p>My template allows me to have the same daily note created for me each day. Here&rsquo;s what it looks like:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I&rsquo;ll talk more about each individual section later in this post, but overall this daily note has helped me to become more organized and focused. Its primary purpose is managing tasks and rapidly logging notes throughout the day. Having one place to collect both tasks and quick notes has been helpful for me. A nice perk of doing it in Obsidian is that those quick notes can easily evolve into standalone markdown files if they need to, but the key is having a really <em>low friction</em> place to capture a thought or task.</p>
<p>Having my daily note link to other &ldquo;periodic&rdquo; notes (daily, weekly, monthly) feels very Obsidian-ish, but truth be told I don&rsquo;t use the links too often. They are nice when I need them though, like quickly needing to get to something I logged yesterday.</p>
<p>I used to use the 5 Minute Journal section more than I do now, but this has been replaced by analog journaling. I sort of miss having this stored digitally, and I&rsquo;m sure I could hack together some awesome digital journal dashboard with Dataview, but that&rsquo;s not really the point, is it? Journaling analog helps me to slow down and really reflect, which seems to make my individual sessions more meaningful. And that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m really looking for. All that being said, I do still like using the 5-Minute Journal occasionally when I&rsquo;m feeling scattered and need a quick dose of mindfulness while at my computer.</p>
<p>The Today&rsquo;s Notes section is another one I don&rsquo;t use too often, but it&rsquo;s fun to have. I&rsquo;m not using it to navigate between notes I&rsquo;m currently working on that day, because Obsidian has great navigation features I&rsquo;m using instead (e.g., tabs, search). But I do like having it whenever I take a look at past daily notes. It&rsquo;s fun to see a snapshot of what I worked on any given day, and the combination of the daily log, completed tasks, and Today&rsquo;s Notes paints a nice picture of what I was doing and thinking.</p>
<h1 id="plugins">Plugins</h1>
<h2 id="daily-notes-and-periodic-notes">Daily Notes and Periodic Notes</h2>
<p>These plugins both can create a daily note from a specified template file. Periodic Notes allows the creation of some additional types of notes, like weekly, monthly, quarterly, and yearly.</p>
<p>I prefer to keep my daily notes in their own folder, and each daily note&rsquo;s title is formatted as <code>YYYY-MM-DD</code>.</p>
<p>I keep my template file in &ldquo;Bins/Templates/Daily Note&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s my config for Daily Notes:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Here&rsquo;s my config for Periodic Notes (you&rsquo;ll see I also use weekly and monthly notes, which I link to from my daily note):</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2 id="templater">Templater</h2>
<p>With Templater, if I create a file from a template, either manually or through Daily Notes or Periodic Notes, I can run some code from my template <em>when the template is instantiated</em>. This allows me to get things like the current date, daily quote, date ranges for tasks, and file title at the time when I use the template.</p>
<p>You can even use Templater to run your own JavaScript during note creation, but I am not using that in the current iteration of my daily notes template.</p>
<p>Here is my current config for Templater:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The two important parts are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Specify a template folder (I use &ldquo;Bins/Templates&rdquo;)</li>
<li>Trigger Templater on new file creation. You want this on so that Templater works with Daily Notes and Periodic Notes.</li>
</ol>
<p>I use Templater all over my daily note template, and anything between <code>&lt;% ... %&gt;</code> is Templater syntax.</p>
<h2 id="dataview">Dataview</h2>
<p>Dataview is a powerful way to query data across all of your notes in your Obsidian vault. For my daily note, I use it to display any notes I created or modified that day.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe I did anything unique with the config for Dataview, much of the setup is for viewing preference.</p>
<h2 id="tasks">Tasks</h2>
<p>Obsidian is the main place I track tasks digitally, and I use the Tasks plugin to do that. My full setup with Tasks warrants a separate post, but for my daily note I use it to capture tasks in my Daily Log and to display tasks that are:</p>
<ul>
<li>overdue</li>
<li>due today</li>
<li>coming soon (next 3 days)</li>
<li>completed today</li>
</ul>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t changed much from the default Tasks config. I just have it configured to add a &ldquo;done date&rdquo; each time I complete a task.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2 id="quickadd">QuickAdd</h2>
<p>QuickAdd allows running macros from anywhere in Obsidian. I have a macro setup that can be run from anywhere and allows me to quickly write up text that gets appended at the top of my Daily Log with the current timestamp.</p>
<p>To configure this I created a macro called &ldquo;Capture to daily note&rdquo; in QuickAdd:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In the settings for that macro, I tell it where to add the text, and how to create the Daily Note if it has not already been created:</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>To summarize, QuickAdd looks for today&rsquo;s daily note, and then inserts my supplied text after the header I supplied, which is <code>## Daily Log</code>, and gives it some special formatting that I specify near the bottom of the settings. More on this in the Daily Log Section.</p>
<h2 id="buttons">Buttons</h2>
<p>Buttons allows you to place buttons in your notes that can run macros. I use a button in my daily note templated to run the QuickAdd macro I described above. This allows me to really quickly capture a short note to my daily log, even if I am viewing my Daily Note on reading mode (which is something I end up doing often from mobile).</p>
<h2 id="calendar">Calendar</h2>
<p>I use the calendar plugin to navigate between my daily and weekly notes, and to create them.</p>
<h1 id="the-template">The Template</h1>
<p>You can get the full template from this <a href="https://gist.github.com/jakeweidokal/027072dc75ddc77ec9595739808db592">Gist on Github</a>. Below I&rsquo;ll break down the template by section so you can take only the pieces and parts you need.</p>

<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>For my habits section, I use the YAML frontmatter of the markdown file to track any daily habits. I use Templater to get the week number and save it as a property. I also use the Frontmatter to tag all daily notes with the <code>#daily</code> tag.  After that, all additional front matter fields are used to track daily metrics, which could be things like weight, times, mood, etc.</p>
<p>To be honest, I don&rsquo;t use this much anymore, but it was useful when I was doing intermittent fasting. I was eating within an 8 hour window each day, so I used this section to track when I started eating, when I stopped eating, and my weight. Then, with this data stored in each daily note, I used the Obsidian Charts plugin in my weekly and monthly notes to trend my progress over time. If you are interested in how this is setup, shoot me an email and let me know.</p>

<h3 id="description-2">Description</h3>
<p>All my daily notes have a file title in the format <code>YYYY-MM-DD</code>, but I like having a more readable format that includes the weekday.</p>
<p>I use the <code>tp.date.now</code> function to format the date from the title of the file. Here are what the 4 different parameters in the function do:</p>
<ol>
<li>Format - sets the format for the date</li>
<li>Offset - I keep this at 0 because I want the current date. 1 would give me tomorrow, -1 would give me yesterday.</li>
<li>Reference - the date to use. If not provided, the function uses today&rsquo;s date when a note is created from it. I supply the file title here so that no matter <em>when</em> I make my daily note, the title in the note matches the file title. For example, I might create tomorrow&rsquo;s daily note ahead of time to start taking notes for tomorrow, so I want the file title to be the date used, NOT today&rsquo;s date during note creation.</li>
<li>Reference format - the date format for #3</li>
</ol>

<p>I like having a Daily Log section to rapid log tasks, ideas, notes, etc. throughout the day. I added a button to help me do this for two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>I use Obsidian mobile, and often view notes in reading mode from my phone. Having the button allows me to quickly capture a log even from reading mode</li>
<li>I like having a timestamp for my log entries. It forces a chronological log I can look back on.</li>
</ol>
<p>I described how I configured the QuickAdd macro above in the <a href="#quickadd">QuickAdd Plugin section</a>. Once the QuickAdd macro is configured, I can add the Button to my template and use the <code>command</code> type to call my QuickAdd macro.</p>
<p>I do often add things to my daily note without using the &ldquo;Add to Log&rdquo; button. This section is where I create and store my tasks 97% of the time. That way, my task location is the daily note, so I can easily see the date it was created and I get the associated context of everything else stored in my daily note.</p>

<h4 id="setting-up-css-snippets-for-callout-styles">Setting Up CSS Snippets for Callout Styles</h4>
<p>Before I get into the task queries for the template, I&rsquo;ll mention that I use callouts to contain my task queries because I like the color-coded separation, and I like being able to collapse/expand my task lists. I have set up custom callout styles that I&rsquo;ve tailored to my task system. The default styles would work fine too, but you can set up custom styles with CSS Snippets.</p>
<p>I followed the docs <a href="https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Callouts#Customize+callouts">here</a> to get this set up.</p>
<p>Under &ldquo;Appearance &gt; CSS Snippets&rdquo;, click the folder icon to open your snippets folder (.obsidian/snippets).</p>
<p>In this location, create a file called callouts.css that contains the following:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>.callout[data-callout=&quot;overdue&quot;] {
  --callout-color: 255, 215, 0;
  --callout-icon: alarm-clock;
}

.callout[data-callout=&quot;due-today&quot;] {
  --callout-color: 12, 248, 161;
  --callout-icon: check-square;
}

.callout[data-callout=&quot;coming-soon&quot;] {
  --callout-color: 37, 202, 227;
  --callout-icon: timer;
}

.callout[data-callout=&quot;next-two-weeks&quot;] {
  --callout-color: 42, 165, 227;
  --callout-icon: hourglass;
}

.callout[data-callout=&quot;later&quot;] {
  --callout-color: 127, 128, 222;
  --callout-icon: calendar;
}

.callout[data-callout=&quot;no-date&quot;] {
  --callout-color: 163, 80, 250;
  --callout-icon: calendar-off;
}

.callout[data-callout=&quot;recurring&quot;] {
  --callout-color: 216, 191, 216;
  --callout-icon: repeat;
}

.callout[data-callout=&quot;personal&quot;] {
  --callout-color: 240, 240, 240;
  --callout-icon: user;
}

.callout[data-callout=&quot;work&quot;] {
  --callout-color: 240, 240, 240;
  --callout-icon: briefcase;
}
</code></pre><p>Go back to &ldquo;Appearance &gt; CSS Snippets&rdquo; and click the refresh icon to reload the snippets into Obsidian&rsquo;s styles.</p>
<p>Now you can use these callout type identifiers to style your callouts. These are the custom callout types I use to contain different types of tasks. I don&rsquo;t use all of these in my daily note, some show up in other places like my Tasks Dashboard.</p>
<h4 id="grouping-tasks">Grouping Tasks</h4>
<p>For my daily note, I like my task queries to show tasks in a certain date range (e.g., overdue, due today, due in the next 3 days, completed today) and then within the query, I like to group my tasks by whether they are related to work, personal, or uncategorized. I use tags to assign my tasks to projects, so I look at the tag to determine which group a task should fall into.</p>
<p>My tag structure for organizing tasks has three sections: <code>#{prefix}/{area}/{project}</code>. An example tag would be: <code>#p/personal/website</code>. I prefix all project tags with <code>p/</code> so that I can quickly pull them all up in the typeahead menu when I start typing a tag. The second part of the tag is the area that the project belongs to, which is either &ldquo;work&rdquo; or &ldquo;personal&rdquo; in my setup. This is what I like to group my tasks on.</p>
<p>To accomplish this, at the end of my tasks query I have:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>group by function task.tags.map( (tag) =&gt; tag.split('/')[1] ? tag.split('/').slice(0, 2).join('/') : '')
</code></pre><p>Here&rsquo;s what this is doing for each task:</p>
<ul>
<li>it looks to see, &ldquo;Does this task have a tag with an area section?&rdquo;</li>
<li>if it does, it cuts off the project from the end, and returns the area like: <code>#{prefix}/{area}</code></li>
<li>if it does not, it returns empty</li>
</ul>
<p>So then my tasks fall into one of 3 groups:</p>
<ol>
<li>Personal</li>
<li>Work</li>
<li>Uncategorized</li>
</ol>
<p>My &ldquo;due soon&rdquo; tasks query takes grouping even further, and groups tasks first by their due date and then sub-groups into the areas I defined above.</p>

Kings should not get drunk so they do not tear down what they created while sober. Speak for those who do not have a voice. Judge justly and defend the rights of the poor. A wonderful spouse is rare. They can be trusted and have a good work ethic. Always they provide for their family and plan for their future. They are confident and strong. They help the poor and are not afraid of hard times for which they have prepared. From their mouth flows wisdom and kindness. They are praised by their children and their spouses. Charm and beauty are fleeting, but a spouse who reveres God is praiseworthy. They will get back more than they have put in.</p>

Don&rsquo;t become poor and steal, disrespecting God. Some think themselves clean while covered in filth. Greed is never content; give, and it wants more. If you mock your father, mother, and all authority, there will be consequences. Being suddenly put in a situation for which one is deeply unqualified will lead to disaster. Even small things can be wise; ants, groundhogs, locusts, lizards. The beloved leader walks with the confidence of the lion. If you have been foolish or planning to do evil, restrain yourself. Pressing anger produces strife.</p>

An enemy can feign love with kind words. Everything tastes good to one who is hungry. The goodness of a friend comes from their authentic advice. A close neighbor is better than a far brother. When and where you act is just as important as how. Friends sharpen each other like iron on iron. As gold is refined in the furnace, one is tested by their praise. Pay attention to what you have; your possessions do not watch themselves and will not last on their own.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://www.esv.org/Proverbs+26/">Proverbs 26/31</a> Honor does not fit a fool. Don&rsquo;t answer a fool in their style, but correct their mistakes. A proverb coming from a fool is useless. Fools return to their ways like dogs to their vomit. There is more hope for a fool than one who thinks themselves wise. Do not meddle in other people&rsquo;s fights. Fire dies without wood, and strife dies without a gossiper. One who displays hate hides deceit in their heart; do not trust them when they aim kind words your way. Those who lay traps will fall into them.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://www.esv.org/Proverbs+25/">Proverbs 25/31</a> God, knowing all, conceals. We, knowing little, seek truth. Don&rsquo;t force yourself into high places, it is better to be invited from a lowly place than to be put down in a high place. Don&rsquo;t share other&rsquo;s secrets. Patient and persuasive words may change the course of nations. Take even good things in moderation. Don&rsquo;t be overly joyful in the presence of those with a heavy heart. Provide for your enemy, this is a greater victory than battle. Like a clogged sprinkler is a good one who allows evil. One without self-control is like a house that has been broken into and left open.</p>

Don&rsquo;t envy sinners, go on in reverence and trust there is a future. Don&rsquo;t befriend drunks or gluttons, they will come to ruin and take you with them. Buy truth and don&rsquo;t sell it for anything. Stay away from a flirt, they increase the traitors among mankind.

Pursue righteousness, and you will find it, along with life and honor. Control your speech to stay out of trouble. The wicked act boldly, but the upright openly consider their ways.</p>

Be careful offering bribes, lest you come to depend on them. It is loving to forgive, you will lose friends if you rehash old wounds. A reprimand to the wise penetrates further than a beating to a fool. Friends love through highs and lows. Joy is good medicine, but a crushed spirit is crippling.

			 <p><a href="https://www.esv.org/Proverbs+16/">Proverbs 16/31</a> Every person thinks themselves right, but God weighs the spirit. Commit your work to God and it will be established. Everything is for a purpose, even the wicked. One turns from evil through reverence to God. When a man follows the ways of God, he is at peace even with his enemies. People plan, God establishes. You will discover good things if you ponder the word. Gracious words are sweet to the soul. One&rsquo;s appetite urges them on. A whisperer separates close friends. One who rules their own spirit is better than one who rules a city.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://www.esv.org/Proverbs+15/">Proverbs 15/31</a> A gentle response cools anger, but a harsh response stirs it up. If God knows the depths of hell, how much more does he know the depths of your heart? The cheerful heart has a continuous feast. (Poor + God) &gt; (Rich + Trouble). (Lettuce + Love) &gt; (Filet Mignon + Hatred). The path is easy for the upright, but for the idle, it is like walking through thorns. Plans fail without counsel, but with many advisors, they succeed. The Lord destroys the house of the arrogant but protects the house of the humble. He who hates bribes will live. The heart of the righteous ponders, but the mouth of the wicked pours out. Reverence for God is instruction in wisdom. Humility comes before honor.</p>

A cynic seeks wisdom in vain, but it comes easy for one of understanding. Run from fools. Fools mock those who seek forgiveness, but the upright find it. No one knows your heart like you. Life is both joy and grief, together. The wise are cautious, but fools are reckless. Blessed are those generous to the poor. A ruler is only as good as their people. Be slow to anger.

Prudent ones act with knowledge, but fools flaunt their folly. If disaster pursues you, consider living righteously. One who walks with the wise becomes wise, but a friend of fools hurts themselves.

Better to be unassuming with assets than to be lavish without assets. The evil are ensnared by their words, the good free themselves with their words. A fool is right in his own eyes, but the wise listens to advice. The wise ignore insults, but a fool is clear about their rage. The words of the fool damage, the words of the wise heal. Truth is forever, lies are for a moment. The diligent rule and the idle are put to work.</p>

Beauty without discretion is like a pearl in a pile of crap. One who gives grows richer, one who withholds giving suffers want. Do not put faith in your riches.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://www.esv.org/Proverbs+6/">Proverbs 6/31</a> Do not stake your fate on the reliability of another person. Follow the example of the ant. Keep working. A little laziness and you will quickly become poor. Do not sow discord, you will be broken. Don&rsquo;t be captured by the adulterer. Prostitutes and porn are cheap, but a spouse is worth a life. Don&rsquo;t get too friendly with another&rsquo;s spouse. Can you carry a fire and not be burned? Those that commit adultery destroy themselves and invite revenge.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://www.esv.org/Proverbs+5/">Proverbs 5/31</a> A forbidden lover may seem sweet, but behind the veneer is bitter decay that leads to death. Drink from your own well. Your spouse is for you, and you for your spouse. Take joy in your spouse&rsquo;s loveliness, and delight in their love. One who falls into the arms of the forbidden lover is suddenly and unexpectedly ensnared in an inescapable trap. They die for lack of discipline.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://www.esv.org/Proverbs+4/">Proverbs 4/31</a> The first step in wisdom is seeking and loving wisdom. Guard wisdom like you would your life. Do not step onto the path of evil.

			 <p>Below are some thoughts I typed up the morning before my wife was induced for our first child. I recall feeling especially reflective that morning, and I was trying to prepare myself for what was ahead (note: I was/am still unprepared, but I&rsquo;ve managed to figure things out on the fly so far).</p>
<h1 id="2023-07-05-thoughts-on-the-day-of-the-induction">2023-07-05 Thoughts on the Day of the Induction</h1>
<p>Soon I am going to be a dad and my wife is going to be a mom. It is strange how major change can be right in front of my face, and yet it is hard to believe that it is coming. But how will things change? How can I know what change will be like before it has made its way into my life and started to rearrange things I once cared for? Will I be sad at losing things? Certain freedoms? Or will my values and beliefs be changed?</p>
<p>It feels more like the latter, but I have no idea how that will play out. I think I will miss some freedoms from before having a baby, like getting sleep whenever I want, but on the whole, I think this will be a good change and I am really looking forward to it.</p>
<p>Here is what I think <em>will change</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Less sleep, especially early on</li>
<li>I will develop a larger capacity for love</li>
<li>If I do it right, I will slow down and see the world through a child&rsquo;s eyes once again</li>
<li>Life will become less flexible in some ways - not able to disc golf as much, trickier to go into the office for work, etc.</li>
<li>My wife and I will need to unite around a common goal in a way that we really haven&rsquo;t had to before</li>
<li>Less time to myself</li>
<li>More laughter</li>
<li>Really more of all emotions. I think life will become more vivid and intense, as long as I lean in</li>
<li>More walks (I am really excited to use the fancy stroller we got 😂)</li>
<li>Less of an aversion to grossness. Getting accustomed to changing dirty diapers and getting poo/pee on myself</li>
<li>More wonder and awe</li>
<li>More prioritizing family. It is easy to dive into work and get consumed with projects I am working on, but I think it will become easier/more important to be giving myself to my family</li>
<li>Less self-centeredness</li>
<li>Less screen time (This will not magically change on its own, but I will be focusing on this. I do NOT want to be the dad that has his face in his phone while his daughter is wanting to be seen by him.)</li>
<li>My WHY will be strengthened. I will have more purpose and conviction behind my actions.</li>
<li>The burden of responsibility on my shoulders will be increased</li>
</ul>
<p>Someday when my daughter describes her dad <em>I hope she will say</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>He loved me</li>
<li>We had so much fun together</li>
<li>He was goofy and embarrassed me in school</li>
<li>He was my example for following Jesus</li>
<li>He showed me how a good man should treat me</li>
<li>He could beat up all the other dads 😂</li>
<li>He was there when I needed a shoulder to cry on</li>
<li>He got out of his comfort zone to try things I wanted to do</li>
<li>He didn&rsquo;t raise his voice at me unless he had to keep me safe</li>
<li>He loved mom</li>
<li>He encouraged my interests</li>
<li>He taught me right from wrong</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="reflections">Reflections</h1>
<p>Now that I my daughter is over 5 months old, I&rsquo;m impressed with my past self that most of his predictions were pretty close. I&rsquo;d like to reflect on some of what I got right/wrong.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Will I be sad at losing things? Certain freedoms? Or will my values and beliefs be changed?</p>
<p>It feels more like the latter, but I have no idea how that will play out.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have found it to be true that my values have shifted some. It was not such a big and dramatic immediate change as I had expected, but I have not felt sad about losing any freedoms from before my daughter was born.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I will develop a larger capacity for love</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if my capacity for love is larger or not, but close moments with her do hit differently. Baby giggles or moments when it is just the two of us looking into each other&rsquo;s eyes make my heart so full.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If I do it right, I will slow down and see the world through a child&rsquo;s eyes once again</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am still working on this, and I want to do this more. I think I will be forced into this soon, as she will begin crawling in the next couple of months, so I&rsquo;m going to need to put my baby cap on to identify all the hazards we may still have on the floors.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My wife and I will need to unite around a common goal in a way that we really haven&rsquo;t had to before</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes. Having a baby has been very uniting, but also brings about a number of disagreements over strongly held opinions on parenting. So far, we have centered around &ldquo;safety&rdquo; as our tiebreaker to determine which opinion we should go with when we can&rsquo;t come to agreement through talking about it. It is interesting that so many of our opinions are rooted in our own childhood experiences, so in a lot of our disagreements it is more important to empathize with each other about past experiences than to rationalize about the current situation. When we empathize, we both tend to feel much better about the approach we decide on. The core to all of this is a mutual understanding that we are on the same team, and we both want the best for our daughter, even when we are coming at it from different angles.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Less time to myself</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finding time for <em>me</em> has become much more challenging. The only alone time I&rsquo;ve found has come early in the morning, before the girls are awake. Surprisingly though, changing diapers in the middle of the night has made it <em>easier</em> to get up early. It has been very refreshing for me to get up around 4:30 or 5:00, make a warm cup of coffee, and then either journal, read a book, or work on a personal project. I&rsquo;d like to incorporate more exercise into my &ldquo;me time&rdquo;, but the time feels so short and I&rsquo;m having way more fun doing stuff like writing this post. I know I will feel so much better if I just suck it up and do the exercise though, and I can find ways to be fast and still have time for the other things I enjoy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Really more of all emotions. I think life will become more vivid and intense, as long as I lean in</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When I can keep myself free from attention-grabbing distractions (looking at you, phone) and I can focus my whole being on time with my family, this is true. I have found that I am still just as prone toward distraction though, and while I get distracted with flashy colors and noises (YouTube), the color in front of my eyes slowly sucks the color out of life around me. I feel grayer and duller when I am giving into distractions. It is sad that this numbing has become the norm in our society, with so many of us getting off of work and going straight to TV, phone, video games, you name it. I think my disclaimer &ldquo;as long as I lean in&rdquo;, holds true here. I need to constantly check in with myself to be sure that I am leaning in.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>More walks (I am really excited to use the fancy stroller we got 😂)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This has saved me from my lack of a workout routine. What I didn&rsquo;t account for, though, was how much I&rsquo;d be walking around the house carrying the baby. That is a workout in itself! I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve gained strength in my upper body, but my endurance is way higher now that I am carrying a baby all the time.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>More prioritizing family. It is easy to dive into work and get consumed with projects I am working on, but I think it will become easier/more important to be giving myself to my family</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This has not come automatically. I&rsquo;ve tried to do this, but I have to really work for it. Work issues can seem so urgent, and personal projects can feel so much more fun than changing diapers. I must patiently remind myself of the value of being with my family when other things are constantly pulling at me. This value is realized on a scale of years, or even decades, when my family will be able to look back and see how much I loved them, even in the little moments. This perspective is hard to have when so many other things feel like they need my attention NOW and I could see results on them right away.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The burden of responsibility on my shoulders will be increased</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This sounds so serious and heavy lol. Yes this is true, but I haven&rsquo;t felt weighed down at all.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Someday when my daughter describes her dad <em>I hope she will say</em>:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I won&rsquo;t be able to reflect on the real-life outcomes of this section for another 20+ years. But all of these hopes are still true. I was emotional as I wrote it originally, and I am emotional again thinking about this. It really all boils down to: <em>I hope she feels loved by me, and I hope she reciprocates it</em>. It feels scary to think that one or both of these could not be true in 20+ years. But I get emotional thinking about how joyful I will be if both are true.</p>
<p>All in all, being a dad has been awesome. I would do it again, but not anytime too soon. Right now I am perfectly content with just having one daughter and learning how to love her well.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve never considered my handwriting to be great, but I&rsquo;ve been doing a lot more writing by hand recently so I resolved to make an effort to write more legibly.</p>
<p>The first thing I tried was to add more space between each character and each word, and that alone made a huge difference! Actually, it&rsquo;s enough of an improvement that I&rsquo;m content with my handwriting for now and won&rsquo;t be trying any more improvements for a while. Keeping some level of messiness feels necessary to maintain the <em>soul</em> of my style.</p>
<p>Focusing on pushing my hand out to the right to separate each character has made my writing feel like it flows a lot better. I think before I was overly focused on cramming each word tightly together so I could maximize the space on each page. In fact, since making this change, part of me still feels guilty for taking up more space on the page with each word. Somehow it feels wasteful, and I&rsquo;m surprised I could feel guilty about something so trivial. I try to remind myself that whitespace has value too. It brings separation, clarity. It lays the canvas from which each character or word is defined. Having too much ink smushed together muddles everything up. Each stroke is only as good as the accompanying whitespace that makes it a stroke at all.</p>
<p>As I think about whitespace in a literal sense and how it has improved my writing, it makes me wonder about whitespace in a figurative sense. Are there areas in my life where I am trying too hard to cram &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; together, and a little whitespace might bring separation and clarity? What does whitespace even mean, in that sense?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve always journaled in some capacity, but I&rsquo;ve really gotten back into it recently. I&rsquo;m bullet journaling daily, partially to track personal to-dos, partially to log what is happening each day, but mostly to force myself to review what is happening each month and each day. The slowness of the practice helps me retain my schedule better in my brain. I&rsquo;m also doing morning pages most mornings to declutter my mind at the start of each day. As part of this renewed interest in journaling, I&rsquo;ve gotten back into fountain pens. Right now, I&rsquo;m using a <a href="https://a.co/d/elJ2Eby">Lamy Safari</a> with <a href="https://a.co/d/8rP2yg2">Diamine Red Dragon</a> ink.</p>
