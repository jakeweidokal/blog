				"title": "Thoughts on homeschool",
				"content_html": "<p>Three years ago, homeschooling was not on my mind. But now that I have a daughter, I&rsquo;ve been thinking about it more. I want the best for her and I&rsquo;m trying to figure out who would give her a better education: the school system, or me? I have my doubts in the school system, but then I also have my doubts in myself. Like others who grew up in the public school system, I have unfounded prejudices against homeschooling and admittedly don&rsquo;t know much about it. But as I&rsquo;ve looked into it, I think it might be a good path for my family. So I decided to take my wife and daughter to a homeschool convention to learn more about what it takes to be a homeschool family.</p>\n<p>Before I went, when I told people where I was going, I got the sense that most people hadn&rsquo;t thought much about homeschool either. When I said &ldquo;homeschool convention&rdquo;, the initial response was a twitched eyebrow and an attempt to not make a weird face. &ldquo;Oh&hellip; why?&rdquo;, they would ask.</p>\n<p>I started seriously considering homeschooling when my wife became pregnant with our first child. She was pro-homeschool. I was&hellip; getting there. But through lots of conversation and research, we&rsquo;ve come to be aligned in our views on homeschooling. Homeschooling is now my go-to answer for the question, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s something you&rsquo;ve changed your mind about?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>I had a hard time getting over the stigma with homeschool. I wondered, &ldquo;If our kid did that, won&rsquo;t she grow up isolated and weird?&rdquo; Isn&rsquo;t homeschooling only for mega hardcore religious fundamentalists, and people deeply distrustful of &ldquo;the system&rdquo;? Or for sweet but socially awkward midwestern families? Or for kids who just can&rsquo;t cut it in a public school? Or for backwoods recluses? Or for&hellip; you get it.</p>\n<p>I still wrestle with that worry, because homeschooling is unfamiliar to me. My wife and I came up in the Ohio public school system. We did well in school. I went on to graduate college and have a successful career in software development. Neither of us had horribly traumatic experiences in the public school system, other than the trauma du jour of adolescence. So then my question is, how could <em>I</em> do any better teaching my kid than what the public school system did for me? At least I got socialized, kind of.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m not sure I can do better. And that&rsquo;s why I wanted to go to a convention to learn more about homeschool. So down to Columbus, Ohio I drove with my wife and my two-year-old daughter to attend the Great Homeschool Convention.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-convention\">The Convention</h2>\n<p>The first thing I learned is that this convention was not designed for two-year-olds. It mostly consisted of workshops (presentations) and an exhibit hall swarming with hundreds of vendors. There was a daycare for kids, but the minimum age was three years old, so we lugged our daughter from workshop to workshop, exhausting our supply of snacks and toys to keep her entertained.</p>\n<p>What set me most at ease about homeschooling was observing the people. I was keen to measure the weird-factor of other attendees to see if my prejudices of homeschoolers were justified. Much to my relief, they were not. The parents looked like any other parents. The kids seemed normal.</p>\n<p>But I didn&rsquo;t go only to judge people. I also wanted to learn. There were hundreds of workshops to choose from, with some on homeschooling, parenting, literature, math, organization, and more. The workshops we chose to attend were a mixed bag ranging from &ldquo;wow, that was great!&rdquo; to &ldquo;get me out of here, now&rdquo;. But through the good and the bad, there were some important lessons I took away.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-lessons\">The Lessons</h2>\n<h3 id=\"1-cultivate-a-love-for-learning\">1. Cultivate a Love for Learning</h3>\n<p>In the first workshop we attended, the speaker mentioned that cultivating a love for learning should be the primary goal of the homeschooling parent. &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;, I thought, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it!&rdquo;. I knew there was something in homeschooling that I didn&rsquo;t see in the public school system, and this was it.</p>\n<p>In public schools, I have no idea what kind of teachers my kid will get. She may get the inspiring, lifelong learner who motivates her students. Or she may get the guy that clocks in, follows the curriculum, and clocks out. Or she may get someone with a nihilistically warped view of the world. It&rsquo;s a random grab bag, and I suspect the odds are skewed more in the negative direction. I don&rsquo;t feel that way through any fault of the teachers. I have friends who are great teachers, but our system does not respect or reward great teachers. The salary is meager and it is unfortunately not a position that is held in high esteem. I wish it were different, but this is the system we have.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m fortunate to have a love for learning now, but I don&rsquo;t think it was the public school system that gave that to me. I certainly wasn&rsquo;t actively trying to learn outside of school. I did what I had to do, and I saw learning as something that &ldquo;had to be done&rdquo;. But I wish I saw it as something that I was blessed to do. That I was so lucky and privileged to do. And that&rsquo;s what I want to pass on to my daughter too.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m 100% certain that my passion and enthusiasm for learning could match that of some of the best public school teachers. And I think that&rsquo;s really the most important thing. I don&rsquo;t have all the credentials or know any teaching theory, but I love learning. And I plan on sharing that love for learning with my kids!</p>\n<h3 id=\"2-learn-for-yourself-first-and-lead-by-example\">2. Learn for Yourself First and Lead by Example</h3>\n<p>I certainly couldn&rsquo;t teach a love for learning though if I didn&rsquo;t have it myself. So another big takeaway from the convention is that I really need to prioritize learning for myself. My daughter is only two, so there&rsquo;s not a ton of homeschooling to be doing right now. But I can dive into my own learning to become a more complete and well-rounded man.</p>\n<p>One of the workshops that really inspired me to learn was on &ldquo;painful books&rdquo;. It was two gentlemen discussing classic tragic novels that have powerful messages. A few of them were books that I had read in school. I really want to revisit those books and some of the others that were discussed. Now that I am older, I can see the importance of these books. But in school they just seemed like some dusty and crusty relic I had to crack to get a good grade. So I didn&rsquo;t internalize the lessons as much as I could have. But the lessons are there. These are books that I would love for my daughter to read some day, but how could I take myself seriously if I thought they were important for her but not for me!</p>\n<p>Another inspiring workshop was on entrepreneurship. I really want my daughter to have an entrepreneurial mindset, but I have not done much entrepreneurial work myself! My internal hypocrite alarm bells were going off. I came away from this workshop excited about learning how to start a micro-business, which is something I had already been thinking about with <a href=\"https://weidok.al/2024/09/18/indie-hacking.html\">Indie Hacking</a>, so that I can share that with my daughter someday. I get really excited thinking about her trying to start her own business as a kid, and the excitement she&rsquo;ll get when the first dollar rolls in as a result of something she has created. I see this as a great way to learn all those important life skills that I lament not learning from public school: personal finance, self-organization, persuasion, etc.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3-leverage-what-works-for-you\">3. Leverage What Works for You</h3>\n<p>Every time I turned around at this convention, somebody was trying to sell me something. A lot of vendors were trying to sell a philosophy. I was surprised at all the competing philosophies for homeschooling. There&rsquo;s the classical philosophy, which is pretty rigid and focuses on classical literature. Then there&rsquo;s unschooling, which focuses on child-led experiential learning. And there&rsquo;s a whole gamut in between.</p>\n<p>But all the vendors want to lock you into THEIR philosophy because it is THE BEST way to learn.</p>\n<p>But the first workshop reinforced an important lesson: Just do what works. Every single kid is different. No philosophy is best, and you might need a smattering of them.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m probably biased by my work experience in software development, but it reminded of the agile principles. Simplicity, sustainability, and regular reflection. I think that&rsquo;s the key, and that&rsquo;s how I want to run my homeschool. We&rsquo;ll try things out, and we&rsquo;ll discard what isn&rsquo;t working. Constant iteration and feedback.</p>\n<h3 id=\"4-live-boldly\">4. Live Boldly</h3>\n<p>Since I had a pre-conceived notion of homeschoolers being quiet and awkward, I was surprised by the contrast of how boldly people endorsed it. I got to hear from a lot of people who homeschooled their kids, had an amazing experience, and were incredibly proud of it.</p>\n<p>Another interesting aspect of the convention was that it leaned heavily Christian. Many of the speakers were Christian speakers, and I was impressed by the way they boldly shared the interplay between their faith and their choice to homeschool.</p>\n<p>That was convicting to me. I felt inspired to live more boldly, not just in my faith and homeschooling, but in all areas.</p>\n<h3 id=\"5-take-side-quests\">5. Take Side Quests</h3>\n<p>This lesson didn&rsquo;t come from any of the workshops. I just found that some of the best parts of the convention were when we left and did our own thing. For example, one day we went and explored Columbus&rsquo;s North Market. That was a really fun couple of hours that we could have easily missed out on!</p>\n<p>While the convention was the reason we were in Columbus, it wasn&rsquo;t lost on me that there was a lot more to explore. Some of which might be an even better experience for my family than the convention. My takeaway was that wherever I find myself, I want to make sure to keep my eyes open so I don&rsquo;t miss the opportunities right down the street. There&rsquo;s usually a side quest worth pursuing, if you&rsquo;re willing to set aside your main quest for a little bit.</p>\n<h3 id=\"6-dont-be-afraid-to-leave-a-crappy-situation\">6. Don&rsquo;t be Afraid to Leave a Crappy Situation</h3>\n<p>Vendors sure know how to drag you into a conversation you don&rsquo;t want to be a part of. I wish I had been better at saying, &ldquo;Actually, I&rsquo;m not interested&rdquo; as they launched into their canned spiel about their product or service. I got better at this as the convention went on, but yeesh it feels icky getting stuck in those situations. And it&rsquo;s okay to just end it! It&rsquo;s actually the more humane thing to do. I&rsquo;d rather not let this person waste their breath on me knowing full well that I will forget their product as soon as I step away from the table.</p>\n<p>I did just get up and leave in the middle of one of the workshops. My wife was with our daughter while she napped, so I went to a workshop on her behalf about working as a medical transcriptionist while homeschooling.</p>\n<p>Looking back, it is painfully obvious that this was always going to go how it did. The speaker launched right into a story about her becoming a transcriptionist and starting a company for it and so on. But it became clear immediately that this was a sales pitch to buy her company&rsquo;s multi-thousand dollar course to become a medical transcriptionist. I wish I would have looked into her company before going to the workshop. No thanks. I got up, shuffled past the bright-eyed moms in the room, and got out of their as soon as I could.</p>\n<p>You don&rsquo;t need to stay in a crappy situation. Once you see it for what it is, leave.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-end\">The End</h2>\n<p>I&rsquo;m glad I went to the homeschool convention, but it was an exhausting couple of days. I&rsquo;m not sure whether I&rsquo;ll go back. I&rsquo;ve had the experience once, and now that I&rsquo;ve had it, I think I can just do research online and look up products/services for homeschooling closer to when I need them. In my mind, the value of bringing all these people together in-person <em>should</em> be connecting with other like-minded people to learn from them, but that wasn&rsquo;t structurally part of it. It felt more like a sales floor than a place of community and connection. Which is a bummer.</p>\n<p>But on a positive note, I left filled with ideas of ways I want to improve myself and prepare to be a homeschooling dad. It still feels weird to identify with homeschool, but I no longer see it as a bad thing. I choose to boldly be what I believe is best for my daughter so that I can give her something that will serve her throughout her life: a deep love for learning.</p>\n",

The workshops we chose to attend were a mixed bag ranging from \"wow, that was great!\" to \"get me out of here, now\". But through the good and the bad, there were some important lessons I took away.\r\n\r\n## The Lessons\r\n\r\n### 1. Cultivate a Love for Learning\r\n\r\nIn the first workshop we attended, the speaker mentioned that cultivating a love for learning should be the primary goal of the homeschooling parent. \"Yes!\", I thought, \"That's it!\". I knew there was something in homeschooling that I didn't see in the public school system, and this was it.\r\n\r\nIn public schools, I have no idea what kind of teachers my kid will get. She may get the inspiring, lifelong learner who motivates her students. Or she may get the guy that clocks in, follows the curriculum, and clocks out. Or she may get someone with a nihilistically warped view of the world. It's a random grab bag, and I suspect the odds are skewed more in the negative direction. I don't feel that way through any fault of the teachers. I have friends who are great teachers, but our system does not respect or reward great teachers. The salary is meager and it is unfortunately not a position that is held in high esteem. I wish it were different, but this is the system we have.\r\n\r\nI'm fortunate to have a love for learning now, but I don't think it was the public school system that gave that to me. I certainly wasn't actively trying to learn outside of school. I did what I had to do, and I saw learning as something that \"had to be done\". But I wish I saw it as something that I was blessed to do. That I was so lucky and privileged to do. And that's what I want to pass on to my daughter too.\r\n\r\nI'm 100% certain that my passion and enthusiasm for learning could match that of some of the best public school teachers. And I think that's really the most important thing. I don't have all the credentials or know any teaching theory, but I love learning. And I plan on sharing that love for learning with my kids!\r\n\r\n### 2. Learn for Yourself First and Lead by Example\r\n\r\nI certainly couldn't teach a love for learning though if I didn't have it myself. So another big takeaway from the convention is that I really need to prioritize learning for myself. My daughter is only two, so there's not a ton of homeschooling to be doing right now. But I can dive into my own learning to become a more complete and well-rounded man.\r\n\r\nOne of the workshops that really inspired me to learn was on \"painful books\". It was two gentlemen discussing classic tragic novels that have powerful messages. A few of them were books that I had read in school. I really want to revisit those books and some of the others that were discussed. Now that I am older, I can see the importance of these books. But in school they just seemed like some dusty and crusty relic I had to crack to get a good grade. So I didn't internalize the lessons as much as I could have. But the lessons are there. These are books that I would love for my daughter to read some day, but how could I take myself seriously if I thought they were important for her but not for me!\r\n\r\nAnother inspiring workshop was on entrepreneurship. I really want my daughter to have an entrepreneurial mindset, but I have not done much entrepreneurial work myself! My internal hypocrite alarm bells were going off. I came away from this workshop excited about learning how to start a micro-business, which is something I had already been thinking about with [Indie Hacking](https://weidok.al/2024/09/18/indie-hacking.html), so that I can share that with my daughter someday. I get really excited thinking about her trying to start her own business as a kid, and the excitement she'll get when the first dollar rolls in as a result of something she has created. I see this as a great way to learn all those important life skills that I lament not learning from public school: personal finance, self-organization, persuasion, etc.\r\n\r\n### 3. Leverage What Works for You\r\n\r\nEvery time I turned around at this convention, somebody was trying to sell me something. A lot of vendors were trying to sell a philosophy. I was surprised at all the competing philosophies for homeschooling. There's the classical philosophy, which is pretty rigid and focuses on classical literature. Then there's unschooling, which focuses on child-led experiential learning. And there's a whole gamut in between.\r\n\r\nBut all the vendors want to lock you into THEIR philosophy because it is THE BEST way to learn.\r\n\r\nBut the first workshop reinforced an important lesson: Just do what works. Every single kid is different. No philosophy is best, and you might need a smattering of them.\r\n\r\nI'm probably biased by my work experience in software development, but it reminded of the agile principles. Simplicity, sustainability, and regular reflection. I think that's the key, and that's how I want to run my homeschool. We'll try things out, and we'll discard what isn't working. Constant iteration and feedback.\r\n\r\n### 4. Live Boldly\r\n\r\nSince I had a pre-conceived notion of homeschoolers being quiet and awkward, I was surprised by the contrast of how boldly people endorsed it. I got to hear from a lot of people who homeschooled their kids, had an amazing experience, and were incredibly proud of it.\r\n\r\nAnother interesting aspect of the convention was that it leaned heavily Christian. Many of the speakers were Christian speakers, and I was impressed by the way they boldly shared the interplay between their faith and their choice to homeschool.\r\n\r\nThat was convicting to me. I felt inspired to live more boldly, not just in my faith and homeschooling, but in all areas. \r\n\r\n### 5. Take Side Quests\r\n\r\nThis lesson didn't come from any of the workshops. I just found that some of the best parts of the convention were when we left and did our own thing. For example, one day we went and explored Columbus's North Market. That was a really fun couple of hours that we could have easily missed out on!\r\n\r\nWhile the convention was the reason we were in Columbus, it wasn't lost on me that there was a lot more to explore. Some of which might be an even better experience for my family than the convention. My takeaway was that wherever I find myself, I want to make sure to keep my eyes open so I don't miss the opportunities right down the street. There's usually a side quest worth pursuing, if you're willing to set aside your main quest for a little bit.\r\n\r\n### 6. Don't be Afraid to Leave a Crappy Situation\r\n\r\nVendors sure know how to drag you into a conversation you don't want to be a part of. I wish I had been better at saying, \"Actually, I'm not interested\" as they launched into their canned spiel about their product or service. I got better at this as the convention went on, but yeesh it feels icky getting stuck in those situations. And it's okay to just end it! It's actually the more humane thing to do. I'd rather not let this person waste their breath on me knowing full well that I will forget their product as soon as I step away from the table.\r\n\r\nI did just get up and leave in the middle of one of the workshops. My wife was with our daughter while she napped, so I went to a workshop on her behalf about working as a medical transcriptionist while homeschooling.\r\n\r\nLooking back, it is painfully obvious that this was always going to go how it did. The speaker launched right into a story about her becoming a transcriptionist and starting a company for it and so on. But it became clear immediately that this was a sales pitch to buy her company's multi-thousand dollar course to become a medical transcriptionist. I wish I would have looked into her company before going to the workshop. No thanks. I got up, shuffled past the bright-eyed moms in the room, and got out of their as soon as I could.\r\n\r\nYou don't need to stay in a crappy situation. Once you see it for what it is, leave.\r\n\r\n## The End\r\n\r\nI'm glad I went to the homeschool convention, but it was an exhausting couple of days. I'm not sure whether I'll go back. I've had the experience once, and now that I've had it, I think I can just do research online and look up products/services for homeschooling closer to when I need them. In my mind, the value of bringing all these people together in-person *should* be connecting with other like-minded people to learn from them, but that wasn't structurally part of it. It felt more like a sales floor than a place of community and connection. Which is a bummer. \r\n\r\nBut on a positive note, I left filled with ideas of ways I want to improve myself and prepare to be a homeschooling dad. It still feels weird to identify with homeschool, but I no longer see it as a bad thing. I choose to boldly be what I believe is best for my daughter so that I can give her something that will serve her throughout her life: a deep love for learning.\n",

Maybe even more than the big things.</p>\n<p>Today, my email inbox got flooded with probably about 20 different messages from co-workers thanking me and appreciating a little thing that I did. I even had one guy call me just out of the blue. This was a gentleman I had never talked to before. He said something like, &ldquo;Hey man, I really appreciated what you did. I&rsquo;ve never seen anyone do that that way, and if you ever want me to run your name up the chain and give you a job or something like that, I would be happy to do it.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;No, no, thank you. That&rsquo;s okay, I&rsquo;m perfectly happy with what I&rsquo;m doing now.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>But the thing I did that generated all this commotion and appreciation was just taking meeting notes in a meeting and sharing them out. We had a big all-hands meeting with our whole organization today and leadership shared a lot of really important organizational updates and strategy thoughts about where things are going. And like I always do in meetings, I just took notes. I tend to take pretty detailed notes, and usually I just keep them to myself, or maybe I&rsquo;ll share them with a small subset of people on my team or someone who was out of the office, for example.</p>\n<p>But today, I was like, I don&rsquo;t know, there was so much good stuff in that meeting. Why don&rsquo;t I just send it out to the whole organization? I think the invite list was 200 or 300 people, and I thought, &ldquo;Ah, what the heck? I&rsquo;ll just send it.&rdquo; I didn&rsquo;t expect to get much of a reply, but the kind of outpouring of love and support was shocking to me. A lot of people really appreciated that and seemed hungry for more things like that.</p>\n<h2 id=\"career-impact-of-small-details\">Career Impact of Small Details</h2>\n<p>It just got me thinking about how, especially in your career, those little things can have so much leverage and might be even more important than the big things in some ways. I&rsquo;ve delivered on major organizational priorities well ahead of time, and I think with better quality than we expected. This is what everyone focuses on in their job - those kinds of things. But never have I gotten the same level of recognition or love for doing something like that.</p>\n<p>These major things that we think are priorities for the organization and our priorities, but I think what people really notice and appreciate and care about, and what really can set you apart, is just doing the little things really well, and just having attention to detail. I think the way that you do one thing or the way that you do a little thing kind of represents the way that you do everything, and people pick up on that.</p>\n<h2 id=\"practical-examples-of-impactful-small-actions\">Practical Examples of Impactful Small Actions</h2>\n<p>I just thought that was a really cool example today and wanted to share about that. I think there are all sorts of other little things that we can focus on doing better that would make a big difference.</p>\n<p>One is taking meeting notes like that. The other thing that I&rsquo;ll do with meeting notes that I think is really high leverage and high impact is just reviewing them after you take them. After you take your notes, give yourself five or ten minutes to go through them and then kind of extract. What I&rsquo;ll do is put a key takeaways or actions section at the top and just extract from the notes and pull out what is the really important stuff. Because a lot of times, as I&rsquo;m writing the notes I might not know what is going to be the most important thing that gets shared, so I&rsquo;ll go after the fact and pull out what I really need to know.</p>\n<p>I think honestly, a lot of little things just boil down to that. Just to reviewing things. Like another little thing is put some attention and detail into emails. Don&rsquo;t just type something up real quick and fire it off - give it another one minute review. Just looking over an email almost every time. When I reread my email, I&rsquo;ll find something to fix and usually more than just a typo, just like, &ldquo;Oh yeah, this sentence or two maybe wasn&rsquo;t that clear. Maybe I can combine them.&rdquo; Or &ldquo;This thing that I put down at the bottom I really should put up top because that&rsquo;s the most important thing or what I really want someone to see.&rdquo; So, I think just being concise and paying attention in emails or Teams or Slack messages goes a really long way.</p>\n<h2 id=\"personal-connections-matter\">Personal Connections Matter</h2>\n<p>Another little thing, too, even just outside of work, that I think is really important and so small is just to call people by their first name. Like, the first sentence you&rsquo;re saying with someone in a conversation, just use their name. Be like, &ldquo;Oh, hey, Jake, what? Yeah, sure, whatever.&rdquo; You know, I think that goes a long way. I&rsquo;ve noticed too, like when other people do that to me, it feels special. It&rsquo;s weird, it&rsquo;s such a small and minor thing, but it feels really meaningful when someone just recognizes your name and speaks to you with your first name and listens closely.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>So those are some of the little things that I try to focus on, especially how I&rsquo;m communicating or documenting things, and I think it goes a really, really long way, and does end up contributing to those bigger things or bigger organizational priorities as well.</p>\n<p>But yeah, I think just putting that attention into those little things - people will notice that, and it will mean a lot to them. And I think if you can elevate your game, that will make others around you want to do the same too.</p>\n",

With LinkedIn being really my only source of social media, I find myself longing for more personal, nitty-gritty, really in-depth content from individuals.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-depth-im-missing\">The Depth I&rsquo;m Missing</h2>\n<p>I think there&rsquo;s the news and news stories that might go deep on a specific subject that a journalist is looking into, or on LinkedIn, someone might go deep on some technical thing they&rsquo;re trying to explain. But I find that what I long for or crave is just a person talking really in depth about something they do or something they have and getting hyper specific into how exactly they do it, why they do it that way, what led them to that point. I find it&rsquo;s just hard to find those things on the web.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-indie-web\">The Indie Web</h2>\n<p>When I started my blog, I got into this subculture on the internet called the Indie web, where it&rsquo;s a lot of people starting their own websites or space on the internet, kind of as this revolt against social media and having a company own all your data that you&rsquo;re uploading and you don&rsquo;t necessarily have control over it.</p>\n<p>The idea of the Indie web is that you own your content, publish to your own site or your own space first and then can syndicate or send that out to the various social media platforms for more reach or distribution. As someone with my own personal blog, I know I don&rsquo;t get a ton of visitors on there. I&rsquo;ve kind of just been posting into the void for the most part.</p>\n<h2 id=\"we-can-get-grittier\">We Can Get Grittier</h2>\n<p>Some of what I&rsquo;ve tried to do on my own blog and would like to do more is just really geek out and get hyper nitty-gritty specific on things that I&rsquo;m really interested in, and that&rsquo;s what I wish I saw more of from other people. Like, especially people in my own life, my friends or my family.</p>\n<p>Even just in conversations, people will talk some about something they&rsquo;re interested in, but I think people have a fear of you not being interested enough or caring. Maybe feeling like what they have to share is invalid or is just weird, so people just seem to not go too deep into whatever it is they&rsquo;re talking about.</p>\n<p>Sometimes I&rsquo;ll try to ask people questions and prod, and especially if I can sense that someone is excited that I&rsquo;m asking about something. I love the experience of that and being able to ask them and let them expand on what they&rsquo;re interested in, but it just seems like in oral conversation, people never really go as deep as they wish they could. And then I feel like online or in writing, people just feel like they need to filter themselves or folks will see them as weird if they go too deep on one particular niche subject.</p>\n<h2 id=\"my-dream-world\">My Dream World</h2>\n<p>My dream world would just be a place where people all had their own blogs and they were hyper specific into all their stuff that they&rsquo;re really interested in. From reading about what people are interested in, you could get a sense of who they are and what really makes them tick and exactly how they&rsquo;re doing things.</p>\n<p>When I have seen examples of people getting into the details of how they do things, I learn from that. If I can see really hyper specific examples of how someone does something, I can take that and incorporate that into my own way of doing things, too.</p>\n<p>I think people tend to want to share from some layer of abstraction or high level about what they&rsquo;re doing or what they&rsquo;ve done, but I would love to just see more people getting into details. Show pictures, show screenshots. Show me the inputs. Show me the outputs. Show me what&rsquo;s happening in between all of that. And really talk about the why and what makes you really excited about that thing.</p>\n<h2 id=\"a-good-example\">A Good Example</h2>\n<p>I think one person I&rsquo;ve seen that does a good job of this is <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/\">Simon Willison</a>. He has a blog - he&rsquo;s a professor somewhere. I don&rsquo;t remember where I stumbled upon his blog not too long ago, but his main focus is AI. He does crazy in-depth blog posts about how he&rsquo;s prompting AI or using it to build these little web tools he creates, and he gets really into details sharing the prompts, sharing the whole conversation, exactly what the output was from AI, what he&rsquo;s learning about how to prompt it, and I just love that.</p>\n<p>I would love to see more of that beyond his very hyper-focused AI content, because that&rsquo;s his interest. It paints a picture of who he is and what he&rsquo;s interested in and what he cares about. But I would love to see that for other things from all sorts of people.</p>\n<p>My friends - I&rsquo;m sure if my friends had blogs where they did things like that, I would get to see this side of them that, you know, I&rsquo;m their friend, but maybe I don&rsquo;t know that side of them that they just don&rsquo;t want to share, for whatever reason. Maybe we haven&rsquo;t been able to get into it deeply in conversation or just share through short little posts on X or whatever. I would love to see more of that.</p>\n<h2 id=\"my-nitty-gritty\">My Nitty Gritty</h2>\n<p>I&rsquo;d like to do more of that with the things I&rsquo;m interested in, too. There are some posts I&rsquo;ve got in the backlog. I&rsquo;d like to write that have been in like a draft or idea state for a long time.</p>\n<p>One example is my wallet, which is also a journal. It&rsquo;s this custom setup that I created and have had for years and have kind of built up and changed and swapped around a bunch over the years. I would love to do just a really long detailed post all about my pocket journal wallet combo and how I&rsquo;ve perfected it exactly to how I want it and how I like it to be and share that.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m sure other people would find that interesting - there&rsquo;s people out there on the web, across millions of people, who could benefit from that or be interested in it. And you know, it tells you something about me and who I am and the things that I care about.</p>\n<h2 id=\"looking-forward\">Looking Forward</h2>\n<p>So, expect to see some more of that from me, if and when I can find some more free time to write on the blog. I&rsquo;m still figuring out the new routine of driving into the office every day, as I&rsquo;m doing right now while I voice record this blog post, but I look forward to doing more of those in-depth nitty-gritty posts.</p>\n<p>And as you being someone reading this, I would love to see the same thing from you. If this inspires you to do more of that, whether on your own blog or in a diary or journal or just on traditional social media, I would love to hear about it. So <a href=\"mailto:jake@weidok.al\">drop me an email</a> or something, and I would be more than happy to read all the way through your super in-depth geeky post about whatever thing it is that you&rsquo;re interested in.</p>\n",

And then I feel like online or in writing, people just feel like they need to filter themselves or folks will see them as weird if they go too deep on one particular niche subject.\n\n## My Dream World\n\nMy dream world would just be a place where people all had their own blogs and they were hyper specific into all their stuff that they're really interested in. From reading about what people are interested in, you could get a sense of who they are and what really makes them tick and exactly how they're doing things.\n\nWhen I have seen examples of people getting into the details of how they do things, I learn from that. If I can see really hyper specific examples of how someone does something, I can take that and incorporate that into my own way of doing things, too.\n\nI think people tend to want to share from some layer of abstraction or high level about what they're doing or what they've done, but I would love to just see more people getting into details. Show pictures, show screenshots. Show me the inputs. Show me the outputs. Show me what's happening in between all of that. And really talk about the why and what makes you really excited about that thing.\n\n## A Good Example\n\nI think one person I've seen that does a good job of this is [Simon Willison](https://simonwillison.net/). He has a blog - he's a professor somewhere. I don't remember where I stumbled upon his blog not too long ago, but his main focus is AI. He does crazy in-depth blog posts about how he's prompting AI or using it to build these little web tools he creates, and he gets really into details sharing the prompts, sharing the whole conversation, exactly what the output was from AI, what he's learning about how to prompt it, and I just love that.\n\nI would love to see more of that beyond his very hyper-focused AI content, because that's his interest. It paints a picture of who he is and what he's interested in and what he cares about. But I would love to see that for other things from all sorts of people.\n\nMy friends - I'm sure if my friends had blogs where they did things like that, I would get to see this side of them that, you know, I'm their friend, but maybe I don't know that side of them that they just don't want to share, for whatever reason. Maybe we haven't been able to get into it deeply in conversation or just share through short little posts on X or whatever. I would love to see more of that.\n\n## My Nitty Gritty\n\nI'd like to do more of that with the things I'm interested in, too. There are some posts I've got in the backlog. I'd like to write that have been in like a draft or idea state for a long time.\n\nOne example is my wallet, which is also a journal. It's this custom setup that I created and have had for years and have kind of built up and changed and swapped around a bunch over the years. I would love to do just a really long detailed post all about my pocket journal wallet combo and how I've perfected it exactly to how I want it and how I like it to be and share that.\n\nI'm sure other people would find that interesting - there's people out there on the web, across millions of people, who could benefit from that or be interested in it. And you know, it tells you something about me and who I am and the things that I care about.\n\n## Looking Forward\n\nSo, expect to see some more of that from me, if and when I can find some more free time to write on the blog. I'm still figuring out the new routine of driving into the office every day, as I'm doing right now while I voice record this blog post, but I look forward to doing more of those in-depth nitty-gritty posts.\n\nAnd as you being someone reading this, I would love to see the same thing from you. If this inspires you to do more of that, whether on your own blog or in a diary or journal or just on traditional social media, I would love to hear about it. So [drop me an email](mailto:jake@weidok.al) or something, and I would be more than happy to read all the way through your super in-depth geeky post about whatever thing it is that you're interested in.\n",

The wind tunnel was incredible. It&rsquo;s the largest wind tunnel capable of supersonic speeds in the country, and can push close to Mach 5. The tunnel complex is spread around 4 acres, as the tunnels weave in and out of buildings containing things like motors, compressors, an air dryer, and more. My favorite part of that tour was getting to see the results of a recent mishap they had. I am the product manager for NASA&rsquo;s Mishap Information System, so I see incidents reported in our system all the time, but it is a completely different story to see the aftermath of a mishap in-person. I can&rsquo;t go into detail about the mishap, but luckily nobody was injured, although it had the potential for severe injuries.</p>\n<p>The SLOPE Lab was also a great tour. I had visited before, but it&rsquo;s always neat to get a refresher on the history of tire design for space-faring rovers. Our tour guide was responsible for designing simulated lunar soil as part of her PhD, and I enjoyed listening to her passionately explain the process of simulating lunar regolith based on data collected from the Apollo missions. It&rsquo;s also fun to get to handle and manipulate their fancy shape-memory alloy springs, which always return to their original shape. Materials science is way over my head, but utterly fascinating.</p>\n<p>The best part of both tours was being able to make the time to provide these tours for my team. Most team members had not seen these facilities before and these tours are great for helping us all feel more connected to NASA&rsquo;s mission.

I had to jump up out of the pool quickly to go catch her. My repeated utterances of &ldquo;Stop! Come back!&rdquo; had no effect, much to my dismay.

I&rsquo;m gonna call it a commute post. It&rsquo;s 6:18 a.m. on Wednesday, March 5th. I&rsquo;m driving into work for the morning. I&rsquo;ve got probably like 42 minutes until I get into work, so I figured, instead of just listening to music or a podcast or a book, I would try talking to my phone and do a blog post just talking out loud, which is something I&rsquo;ve never tried before. With coming into the office more and having a longer commute, I&rsquo;ve found it harder and harder to have time to just sit down and write, so I wanted to try something different, shake things up, and see how this format works.</p>\n<p>In thinking about it, I was trying to figure out what type of topics would work to just talk about in a car because I feel like typically, when I&rsquo;m writing, I have some idea or concept, or maybe even just a concept of a title in my mind, and through writing about it, I&rsquo;m thinking about new angles or counterpoints. Through the writing, I figure out what I&rsquo;m actually writing about. I typically never start with a completely coherent vision, so I wasn&rsquo;t sure how it would work just talking through that. I had some fears of just sounding dumb, to be quite frank, of working through those things in real time.</p>\n<p>After thinking about it, I thought a topic that might work would be just telling stories from my life, things that I&rsquo;ve told a couple times to different people that might be interesting to just have up on the blog and have a record of for myself. As time goes on, I get further and further from each of these stories, and some of the details slip away a little bit more, so I want to memorialize them on the blog. I also want to be able to share them out with family or friends, or whoever.</p>\n<p>For this first one, I figured I would start with something easy, and something that comes up through work a lot - just talking about how I got into the line of work that I&rsquo;m in now. I now work at NASA as a product manager. I own a few of the products at the NASA Safety Center. That includes the NASA Mishap Information System and the NASA Cause Analysis Tool. These are all applications for safety personnel at NASA to use, mostly for data entry and storage for mishaps that happen at NASA. These could be anything from something as small as someone trips and falls, where we need a record of that injury even if it&rsquo;s just a skinned knee, all the way up to millions of dollars of property damage if we lose a satellite or something along those lines.</p>\n<p>I came from a computer science and software background in college and was a software engineer right out of college. But how about I start back at the beginning and talk about where things started, at least in my mind, and then progress through the windy road in my career to where I ended up.</p>\n<p>I wish I could hear more about other people in their career journeys, because I feel like every single person that I&rsquo;ve talked to - when I asked them about where they are now and how they got there - almost nobody had just a clear vision and followed it to a T and knew exactly where they would be. It seems like everybody has this very windy, very interesting path where they&rsquo;re sort of going along slowly and finding their way. And that&rsquo;s how it happened for me, too.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-first-spark\">The First Spark</h2>\n<p>I think a good place to start would be sometime between when I was 7 or 16 years old. I would say I was probably around 11 when my dad bought me a Python programming book for kids. Which sounds like the perfect start to the story for someone in my line of work. But while I&rsquo;m picking this as the beginning, it seemed, and I think really was, pretty inconsequential at the time because he bought me this book when I was 11, and I really just didn&rsquo;t care for it at all. It felt like more school to me, and I just wanted to go outside and play.</p>\n<p>I think I looked at it maybe three times. We might have attempted together to do the different coding exercises in the book - they had little games to show you how to code but also make it fun. I think maybe we did one of those, and then I thought, &ldquo;Man, screw this, I&rsquo;m gonna go outside and play.&rdquo; So that was all that really was at that point in my life. But it&rsquo;s still something that I remember and think back on as maybe something that opened up my eyes and my mind to the possibility that coding is something that I could do.</p>\n<h2 id=\"first-jobs-and-high-school\">First Jobs and High School</h2>\n<p>Fast forward to high school. It was time finally to get a job, and I had two places I was going to apply to. One was a little restaurant right down the road from my parents' place where I had applied to be a dishwasher. The other was Chipotle, where they just had some jobs that opened up. I don&rsquo;t remember exactly how it went, but I believe before I even had an offer at Chipotle, I called the restaurant right away and said, &ldquo;Hey, you know what? I&rsquo;m not interested anymore. I&rsquo;m going to go work at Chipotle.&rdquo; I basically broke up with them right then and there.</p>\n<p>I went and told my mom about it, and she was not happy because I had nothing solidified at that point. She said, &ldquo;You call them back right now and tell them that you&rsquo;re still interested in the job.&rdquo; So I very sheepishly got back on the phone, called that restaurant back, and asked if I could still be considered to work there. I don&rsquo;t remember if I had an offer at the time - I think I might have.</p>\n<p>The way it ended up working out was that I did get a job at Chipotle Mexican Grill. I worked there through a lot of high school. I think it was my junior and senior year, and I think I came back maybe on one winter break in college as well.</p>\n<p>It was an interesting place to work. Anyone who&rsquo;s been in food service will know it&rsquo;s hot and fast-paced. And I am not really a fast-paced person. As you can probably imagine, someone who takes time to sit slowly and write on a blog - I&rsquo;m more in my head and like to really think through things and understand them. There&rsquo;s some of that working at Chipotle, but a lot of it was just &ldquo;get these burritos out and get them out fast.&rdquo; So it was an interesting time of my life. I enjoyed the people, and I definitely enjoyed sampling the food, but I could tell that wasn&rsquo;t anything I wanted to do long term.</p>\n<h2 id=\"college-decisions\">College Decisions</h2>\n<p>Shortly before college, there&rsquo;s that period where you know college is ahead of you and you&rsquo;re trying to figure out what you want to be for the rest of your life. Who am I? Where am I going? Wrestling with all these big questions and trying to figure out what my major should be.</p>\n<p>I had already been thinking about something along the lines of psychology, and I think what probably got me there was being raised in the church and very much thinking about and constantly hearing messages about serving and helping other people. That was something that I felt called to, and I felt was really important and interesting. I didn&rsquo;t quite want to go into the church to be a pastor. It seemed weird to me to mix my income with my place of worship - it just wasn&rsquo;t something for me.</p>\n<p>Something that further confirmed that idea of going into psychology was that our church actually did these surveys where it would give you recommendations about what your job would be. I took this survey and the three recommendations were: youth pastor, bartender, and psychologist. I already had decided I didn&rsquo;t want to do the youth pastor. The bartender - I thought, &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s interesting, but I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s for me.&rdquo; And that kind of just confirmed further that maybe I should go and get a psychology degree.</p>\n<h2 id=\"psychology-to-programming\">Psychology to Programming</h2>\n<p>So I went to college for psychology for my first year. In the spring semester of that year, I got a job working as an undergraduate research assistant in a psychology lab. I went to Kent State University, and Manfred van Dolman had the Van Dolman lab. The general focus was romantic relationships, but I got to work on a bunch of interesting studies.</p>\n<p>I wasn&rsquo;t super involved - it was more so helping with data collection or running different sessions with participants. Some of the things I did: they would have couples go into a room by themselves and just answer questions together. Some of it was about splitting housework - how would they do that? Sometimes these were people who already lived together, sometimes it wasn&rsquo;t. They&rsquo;d also dream about their future. One of my jobs was to just watch these recordings and transcribe them. This was before easy transcription services or AI, so I was just in there listening to all these conversations between my peers trying to figure out relationships.</p>\n<p>Another study was an eye movement study, where I would bring participants into a room. We had a computer set up with a face harness in front of it so they would set their chin on there, kind of like if you go to the eye doctor. Right underneath or below the monitor, there was a camera that was positioned at their eyes. I would get that all configured with their eyes so I could figure out where they&rsquo;re looking on the screen, and then I would leave and just play some images up on the screen and see what they looked at. I think it was images either of males and females just alone or together as couples, and the study was trying to look at where you&rsquo;re looking - are you looking at the person&rsquo;s face, their body, something else?</p>\n<p>I didn&rsquo;t stay around at the lab long enough to find the results of that study, but that was another interesting one to be a part of. But part of working in that lab, one of the things I got to do that definitely led me to where I am now was data coding. All this data they would get at the end, I would have it in a big Excel sheet and aggregate it, and they had some program where they would analyze this data. The grad students had always done it pretty much manually, or they would have one of their undergrad research assistants do it manually, but I found that through this program, it had a little section where you could write scripts to automate some of the manual work that we were doing.</p>\n<p>So I got to work figuring out how to do that and implemented it for the lab, which sped up the data analysis process for the whole lab, and for me too. I didn&rsquo;t have to sit there doing all this mindless work going through each data element and analyzing and coding and tagging each thing. That was maybe the first thing that really piqued my interest - like, &ldquo;Oh, this is really rewarding to be able to just write something on the computer, make the computer do things for me.&rdquo; It was just a small task that I could accomplish, and in the end, I can see that it worked, and now it&rsquo;s done. I found that really rewarding.</p>\n<p>I was doing that and enjoying it, but also while I was working in the lab, I was observing these grad students who were doing their research and just observing that I don&rsquo;t think this was the future for me. They were spending a lot of time in the lab. They seemed stressed. They were all working on their papers - I helped them some with their papers and references at the bottom and the slog of all of that and the research - and I just thought, &ldquo;Man, I don&rsquo;t know if this is for me, and if I can do this, and if this is what I want.&rdquo; Especially the way I was thinking of going, becoming an actual psychologist, it was almost guaranteed that I would need to go to some sort of graduate school, and just my undergraduate degree wouldn&rsquo;t get me very far.</p>\n<h2 id=\"changing-direction\">Changing Direction</h2>\n<p>So thinking about what would come with having to go to grad school, as I neared the end of the semester and got into summer, I was like, &ldquo;Man, I really need to figure something else out because this is just not going to work for me.&rdquo; I was thinking, &ldquo;Well, if not psychology, what the heck do I do?&rdquo; because that was the plan that I went to college with, and I had nothing else in mind.</p>\n<p>But then I thought back to the data coding in the lab that I enjoyed doing, which was basically just writing little scripts in Excel, and then I thought back to that Python book that my dad had got me when I was a kid, and how even though I paid no attention to it really at the time, it was memorable enough that it stuck with me even now. So I was like, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Maybe there&rsquo;s something here to explore.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>I think I went and looked for the Python book and never found it. I don&rsquo;t know if we donated the book or not. I don&rsquo;t know what ever happened to it. It&rsquo;s like a ghost. I really - maybe it didn&rsquo;t even happen, and I made the whole thing up. I&rsquo;ll have to double check with my dad. I&rsquo;m pretty sure it&rsquo;s real, but I&rsquo;ve never found the book. But it was memorable.</p>\n<p>So that summer what I started to do was go on the internet and YouTube and just looked up like &ldquo;coding - where do you start? What is it? How does it work?&rdquo; and just started to play with it some myself just to figure out what it was about, what the possibilities were with the career. I had a lot of fun that summer making just some little tiny web projects, really nothing too fancy because I had no actual experience coding and didn&rsquo;t understand any of the basic fundamentals. I would just follow along precisely with what they were doing. It was probably really only HTML and CSS, so I&rsquo;m not even programming, but just displaying a simple web page. But I had a lot of fun with that, just figuring out how to place the elements on the screen, style them, and make it all work together. I was like, &ldquo;Man, this is really cool.&rdquo;</p>\n<h2 id=\"digital-sciences-and-first-internship\">Digital Sciences and First Internship</h2>\n<p>So I just went for it and switched my major. Kent State had something called digital sciences, which I appreciate. It was very similar to computer science, but you drop some of the high level calculus and more theoretical or sciency computer classes and trade them out for more cross-functional classes based on a focus area. So I was digital sciences with a focus on software development. The types of cross-functional courses I got to take: one was in requirements gathering - how do you do that and get requirements for a software project? I got to take a class on design, and a class on just building a web project together, which was really cool.</p>\n<p>We built an XR mobile app. Kent State, if you don&rsquo;t know, had a really bad shooting back in the day, and they have all sorts of memorabilia or artifacts from that day archived back in a room. If you go request it, you can go see them - gas masks, bullet casings, and various things from that day. We got to go back into that room and see those, and we scanned them with a phone to make 3D digital artifacts. Through this app, we were able to display these 3D artifacts. We had these pedestals we set up in a room, we put QR codes on the pedestals, and then folks would come into the room, grab an iPad, and could point at the pedestal with the iPad. The pedestal was empty, kind of as an artistic representation of the lives that were lost, or the emptiness of that day, but you could still point your iPad at it and see this sort of ghostly 3D artifact rendering of different objects from that day, which was really cool. You could turn them around, and you could zoom in on them and take a look at them. It was opened up to the public so people could come in and see it, which they might not otherwise be able to get access to.</p>\n<p>That was a cool project, and it was just things like that that I got to do with that digital sciences major, which I really appreciated, and I feel like prepared me probably better than a plain computer science degree would for the career I went into.</p>\n<p>In college, I went for an internship at a place called Taazaa. I don&rsquo;t remember how I found them. They were a little custom software shop in Hudson, Ohio, where different businesses would work with them for some website or different software product they would need, and this place would work with them and help them build it out.</p>\n<p>I remember going to the interview for that internship, and typically for interviews for software engineering positions or technical positions, the interview will be very technical where they&rsquo;re asking you programming questions or almost like riddles to solve to make sure that you really understand technically what you&rsquo;re doing. They had some of those, and I&rsquo;m sure they, knowing that it was an intern position, kept them simple. Thinking back on them, they were very easy things I could do with my eyes closed now - very simple sort or FizzBuzz type problems.</p>\n<p>But that was after I think I did that interview after maybe one semester of college or one semester of that major in digital sciences, and really, no programming experience beyond that. So, even these simple questions, I just bombed that interview. It was so bad. I remember walking out of that and just feeling so despondent and dejected, so embarrassed that I had even shown up.</p>\n<p>That was rough, but I don&rsquo;t know why, even still, I thought, &ldquo;You know what? Maybe there&rsquo;s some chance that I can get this thing&rdquo; because I think I did okay just talking to the guy and letting him know what I&rsquo;m interested in, what I&rsquo;m doing, and listening to what they&rsquo;re doing and asking questions. It took him a long time to get back to me. I followed up with him, maybe twice a week or every week, for multiple weeks, until eventually they got back to me and said, &ldquo;Hey, do you want the job?&rdquo; And I said, &ldquo;Oh my gosh, yeah, of course.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>At some point, I asked him, &ldquo;Why me? Why did you give me that job because I feel like I did not do very good on the coding interview,&rdquo; and they said, &ldquo;You know what? You were the only person that followed up consistently. We had other people who did better on the technical interview, but they just didn&rsquo;t follow up, and we didn&rsquo;t see the same interest with them that you had.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Hearing that was another one of those things like the Python programming book that really stuck with me throughout my career and my life - just that value of persistence and interest and energy. I think having those things - almost everything else will work out if you have those things, and people will really pay attention to that.</p>\n<p>So, that was sort of a pivotal moment for me, but the internship itself when I got into it - I really liked the people and the place, they had some interesting work, but honestly I feel bad because I probably just was not ready to be working somewhere at that point. They were very generous with allowing me to use a lot of the paid internship time in training classes on top of my college work, to figure out specific skills related to the work they were doing, to learn how to do it and build some of my own prototypes before building actual things for clients.</p>\n<p>I think I maybe did like one or two little pieces of a product for a client before I ended up leaving that internship, and I still feel bad. I left and got an internship at another place. I was there maybe eight months, and I could tell the look on their face when I said I was leaving. They were like, &ldquo;Are you serious? We spent all this time investing in you. Now, you&rsquo;re just gonna leave?&rdquo;</p>\n<h2 id=\"progressive-insurance\">Progressive Insurance</h2>\n<p>But something better came along. I was at a career fair at Kent State, and I had actually just gone to see the Taazaa guys. They had a booth there, and I was just gonna walk there to go visit them and talk with them. But I had some classes or something, and I got there towards the end of the career fair, and they had already packed up and left. So I was like, &ldquo;Oh well, shoot, that stinks.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>So I was walking out of the building, and then there was a Progressive Insurance booth. As I was walking by, one of them flagged me down and was like, &ldquo;Hey, want to hear about Progressive?&rdquo; And I was like, &ldquo;Oh yeah, sure, whatever, I got some time.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>So I was talking to them. I told them about the internship I&rsquo;m doing, the coursework I&rsquo;m doing, what I&rsquo;m interested in, and they were interested in having me back the next day. They would be doing interviews somewhere, and they invited me for an interview. I got in my resume, they invited me for interviews the next day, and I thought, &ldquo;All right, cool.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>So I went and did the interview there, which went really well. I think maybe I did another interview that went well, and then I got invited to their final round of interviews, which - as a junior in college at this time, maybe a senior - it was just mind-boggling to me for a Fortune 100 company, the expenses they went through for interns even just at the interview stage.</p>\n<p>What ended up happening was all the candidates that had made it that far in the process, they brought us out to their headquarters. We were all local in the area, all college kids local. I don&rsquo;t think there was anyone outside of our commute, but they put us all up in a hotel. We got nice hotel rooms. They brought us onto their headquarters the next day. We got to tour around and see headquarters.</p>\n<p>Progressive actually owns the largest privately held collection of art in the country. The guy who founded it loved art and used it as an investment for the company, so they&rsquo;ve got all these amazing artworks just around the walls all around the hallways of the headquarters building, so that was really cool and inspiring as a young college kid just walking around. They provided food. I was like, &ldquo;This is unreal. I cannot believe this is happening.&rdquo; And then they had a series of interviews throughout the day where you were interviewing with all sorts of different people. Then we left, and eventually I got a call back that I had gotten an internship there.</p>\n<p>The way the internship worked was it started as a summer internship. They put us up in apartments - temporary apartments for the summer. We would live with some other interns, and that was great. I had a lot of fun living with the guys I lived with there who were also interning at Progressive.</p>\n<p>I learned a ton. The position was another software programmer position, working on claims software for Progressive - the software that claims reps use there. So, while not the most inspiring product to work on, the people and the culture of the company and the technology we got to work with - all that was amazing, so I had a lot of fun and learned a ton there. Progressive was great too, like the place before, about providing training, giving me that time to really learn.</p>\n<p>I think that is where my career really took off because that internship got extended into a further internship, or I think maybe it was a part-time job in my last semester of college. I really enjoyed it, and I really went all in on Progressive.</p>\n<p>In college, I had that digital sciences major, but I also had a minor in Spanish. In high school, I had gone on a mission trip, a couple of mission trips actually, down to some Central American countries, and just fell in love with the culture and the language, so I was going for a Spanish minor. That last semester, man, it was loaded because I was trying to graduate a semester early. So I was really cramming things into my last semester. I had all my digital sciences stuff, which I had started on a year late because I started as a psych major. I had this Spanish minor that I had a few classes I had to take, and then I had that part-time job too.</p>\n<p>I was just like, &ldquo;You know what? I cannot do this.&rdquo; So I ended up dropping the Spanish minor with only two classes left to go. It still hurts a little bit, but the decision, and I still stick by it, was just - I don&rsquo;t think I really need or needed that piece of paper. All the lessons about the culture and all the language practice - I learned those either way, and I don&rsquo;t know what I would have done with the actual minor anyways. So that was my decision at the time. I dropped the minor. I still speak Spanish a little bit. We get these bilingual books for our daughter, so I have a lot of fun getting to kind of speak Spanish to her and hopefully teach her some of that.</p>\n<p>Progressive was great. I had that part-time job, which then went to their associate programmer, which was the lowest level, and then worked up to their mid-level programmer and was moving up really quick. I was learning a lot. I was taking on a lot of responsibility, doing a lot of extra things above my level. And I think that was seen, but also just working in a large company like that, there&rsquo;s a lot of processes and bureaucracy involved with moving up and rotating through promotions.</p>\n<p>I had been talking with my manager for a while and was on track to get to their senior programmer level, but it just felt like it was taking a long time. They&rsquo;re like, &ldquo;Oh, we gotta give this other person this thing first, and we&rsquo;ve got you on the list. You&rsquo;re gonna get to that senior programmer position. I have your name on the list, but we just gotta wait till it&rsquo;s the right time.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>I was frustrated with that, even though I loved the company. It just felt like I was progressing very quickly, and there just wasn&rsquo;t really room for me to grow or places for me to go. So I started looking for other jobs, and honestly, I wasn&rsquo;t looking very seriously. I had no intention of leaving Progressive, but I was feeling a little frustrated, and I just thought, &ldquo;You know what? Let me interview at some other companies for these more senior positions, just to see how it goes and learn what the interview process is like, get some practice with it again&rdquo; because I hadn&rsquo;t interviewed for a couple years at that point.</p>\n<p>My criteria was, I would look for jobs that I would not think I would actually get an offer for. But if I did, I would consider taking it because I didn&rsquo;t want to just apply places where I knew if I got the offer, I&rsquo;d tell the place no, and screw a bunch of companies by doing that. So I thought, &ldquo;You know what? I&rsquo;ll just shoot for the stars. Go for places where I don&rsquo;t think that I&rsquo;d get the job, but get some practice interviewing there, and get some feedback about what I&rsquo;m missing, or what I could do better.&rdquo;</p>\n<h2 id=\"nasa\">NASA</h2>\n<p>I applied to a few places. I think I got an offer at one that I turned down, and then I saw this NASA job come up, and this one I really, really did not think I was qualified for. I only applied because of the name on it was NASA. So I was like, &ldquo;Man, how cool would it be to go and work at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The job was very much a diagonal career move because it was a step up in seniority for sure from what I was doing at the time, and also a horizontal move, meaning it was very different work from what I was doing. My role at Progressive, I very much was a programmer day-to-day, writing code, building software applications directly, whereas this NASA job was more managing the work rather than doing the work. So it was a lot of oversight into the technical infrastructure of the team, helping the dev team with their processes, and how they&rsquo;re writing code. At that point, it was less product management, but doing a little bit of product management too - working with stakeholders, gathering requirements, and instead of just building the thing, figuring out what needed to be built and how we would build it instead of just taking orders and building whatever little piece I was told to do.</p>\n<p>That was scary but interesting to me. So I went ahead and applied, and I genuinely did not think at all that I would get the offer. But I went through an initial interview, where they had some questions beforehand, I think about, &ldquo;Hey, you&rsquo;ve got these different projects with competing priorities. How would you handle it?&rdquo; or &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got this new application with these requirements. What kind of technology would you build it in? How would you architect it?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>I liked that they would take home questions because I got to really research. I mean, I spent a lot of time building out a system diagram for this hypothetical system that they asked me about. I think they liked the time that I spent on it. After the fact, after I got the job, they said, &ldquo;Yeah, I don&rsquo;t think anyone else spent that much time on it. Yours were for sure the most detailed answers,&rdquo; which I think just goes back to that persistence and energy that I had learned earlier in life.</p>\n<p>I got called back for another interview, and even though I felt like the interviews and everything were going well, I was just like, &ldquo;Man, I don&rsquo;t know. All these people I&rsquo;m talking to with this job are a lot older than me. The people who would be my peers, a lot of people are 15, 20 years older than me,&rdquo; and I just thought for sure I was gonna get passed up, just due to inexperience, which I wouldn&rsquo;t have faulted them for at all.</p>\n<p>But I got a call one day that I had gotten the job and was just floored and shocked by it, and really couldn&rsquo;t believe it. I remember getting onboarded. My manager at the time, Irene, I remember having a conversation with her before I really started, where she was like, &ldquo;You know, you are younger than a lot of people that work here.&rdquo; And I said, &ldquo;Oh yeah, yeah, I know, I figured, I&rsquo;m aware.&rdquo; And she said, &ldquo;Just feel like you&rsquo;ll handle that okay? If there&rsquo;s some folks who&hellip; there might be just a few folks who are not happy with that,&rdquo; just letting me know that there might be some challenges specifically related to that. And I said, &ldquo;You know what? No problem. I&rsquo;m game for it. I&rsquo;ll figure that out.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>But I do have to say that first year, maybe a year and a half, was a more difficult part of my career, because not necessarily with anyone I worked with directly or other civil servants on my team, but I did feel some of that of, like, &ldquo;Who is this kid coming in here and trying to tell us how to work, help us work better, telling us what to do,&rdquo; which I wasn&rsquo;t necessarily doing. But I was coming in and trying to change some things and make things better. So I think very much there was this perception of &ldquo;Who is this kid? Who let him in here?&rdquo;</p>\n<h2 id=\"growing-at-nasa\">Growing at NASA</h2>\n<p>I actually got a really good clear view of that. I went through this NASA leadership program, which was amazing. It was kind of a select group they picked from. I think a little over 300 people across the agency applied, and they picked 60. I made it in, and that was so cool because we got to travel to all these different centers and learn about the mission and hear from different NASA leadership.</p>\n<p>The part of it I want to share is they did these different feedback assessments or surveys. One was called a 360 feedback assessment, where you were asking everyone around you to give you feedback. At the time that I applied to this leadership program, I&rsquo;d only been with the agency like a month or two. So by the time I was sending out the feedback assessment, I hadn&rsquo;t even been there a year yet. I was still pretty fresh, getting feedback from people around me, and I couldn&rsquo;t see who specifically, but I had it split up where I could see feedback from civil servants versus feedback from contractors.</p>\n<p>From the contract side, I got some feedback that was pretty rough. I think some people might not have realized that the feedback goes directly to me. I think they might have thought that it goes to my supervisor because it was more worded towards a supervisor, like, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why we hired this guy because he doesn&rsquo;t seem like he has a lot of experience, and I have not worked with him enough to know to see if it&rsquo;s gonna work out, and I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s going to. And I think we should have hired someone else.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Especially as someone who had that concern coming into the job, that was a day when I got that feedback where I just thought, &ldquo;Oh, that was rough to hear and to receive.&rdquo; That whole first year, it was a big transition. It felt like I had taken on a lot all in one bite. Despite it being difficult, I am proud of myself for having worked through that because I think now I&rsquo;m in a really good place where I&rsquo;ve built trust with my team and work well with them and really enjoy the work and enjoy the people too.</p>\n<h2 id=\"where-i-am-now\">Where I Am Now</h2>\n<p>Especially the more product side - I&rsquo;m glad I made that jump. I do miss some of the programming and writing code, and I scratch that itch by doing some side projects that I work on. I miss writing code a little bit, but I really enjoy having that bigger picture, getting to make decisions myself. I think what it was before, while it&rsquo;s really rewarding to work on a little piece of code and then be done and see it work, it was more like, &ldquo;Hey, here&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re gonna build. Now, go build it.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>I like being on the other side and being able to implement with my team - not just being like, &ldquo;Hey, here&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re gonna go build, go build it.&rdquo; I mean, sometimes that&rsquo;s the case if it&rsquo;s just a really small, simple thing, but really bringing in my team - bringing in the design side and the developer side and us figuring out together the best way to build something. That has been really rewarding, to maybe make that work even better than ways I had seen before.</p>\n<p>I love that big picture product strategy work. I&rsquo;ve gotten to do some zero-to-one work, like for the NASA Cause Analysis Tool that we built - that did not exist and was a new product we were building. That was a lot of fun to stand up from the ground up and talk with mishap investigators all across the agency and various other people and roles that do root cause analysis to understand, &ldquo;Hey, what do you guys really need? How do you work? What does it look like right now?&rdquo; I got to see all these different, crazy convoluted processes people do right now, and figure out what they need and turn that into a product they can really use.</p>\n<p>We launched that back in March of last year, and we rolled it out iteratively. We rolled out a really small version of it and slowly built on it over time. But even with the limited set of functionality we&rsquo;ve released, people are using it and finding it useful and enjoying it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"wrapping-up\">Wrapping Up</h2>\n<p>So that&rsquo;s a look at how I got where I am. I just arrived at work for the day and parked in my parking spot. So who knows, this might be the last car post I ever do, but I enjoyed it as a way to just stay busy during the commute. Usually, I&rsquo;m listening to a podcast or audiobook. I&rsquo;ve been on a history kick recently. I just finished &ldquo;1776&rdquo; by David McCullough and then just started &ldquo;John Adams,&rdquo; which is also by David McCullough, but that one has felt a little drier, which is why I think I wanted to do this car post today. I was like, &ldquo;You know what? I need to switch it up and do something different.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>I think at the top of the article, I&rsquo;m going to try to put up a clip of the audio so you can listen to it if you want. The clip of the audio might end up being different to the text. I think what I&rsquo;m going to try to do is just use Google Recorder, the recorder app just on my phone to record this, and it makes a transcript live. I think I&rsquo;ll just post the audio clip, but I&rsquo;ll take the transcript, and I think I&rsquo;m just going to dump the whole thing into AI and be like, &ldquo;Hey, fix all the grammatical errors and maybe separate some of this, so it&rsquo;s not just one long blurb of me talking.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>So the audio won&rsquo;t probably won&rsquo;t perfectly match the text, but I&rsquo;m curious to try that out and kind of see how it goes. If it feels like it&rsquo;s modifying my words too much, I&rsquo;ll just post the raw thing up there because I don&rsquo;t want it to be too different from what I&rsquo;ve been talking about.</p>\n<p>Anyways, I&rsquo;m rambling at this point. It&rsquo;s been good talking into my phone for this car ride, and if you read this far, thank you, because this has been a long time of just talking.</p>\n",

I'm gonna call it a commute post. It's 6:18 a.m. on Wednesday, March 5th. I'm driving into work for the morning. I've got probably like 42 minutes until I get into work, so I figured, instead of just listening to music or a podcast or a book, I would try talking to my phone and do a blog post just talking out loud, which is something I've never tried before. With coming into the office more and having a longer commute, I've found it harder and harder to have time to just sit down and write, so I wanted to try something different, shake things up, and see how this format works.\n\n\nIn thinking about it, I was trying to figure out what type of topics would work to just talk about in a car because I feel like typically, when I'm writing, I have some idea or concept, or maybe even just a concept of a title in my mind, and through writing about it, I'm thinking about new angles or counterpoints. Through the writing, I figure out what I'm actually writing about. I typically never start with a completely coherent vision, so I wasn't sure how it would work just talking through that. I had some fears of just sounding dumb, to be quite frank, of working through those things in real time.\n\n\nAfter thinking about it, I thought a topic that might work would be just telling stories from my life, things that I've told a couple times to different people that might be interesting to just have up on the blog and have a record of for myself. As time goes on, I get further and further from each of these stories, and some of the details slip away a little bit more, so I want to memorialize them on the blog. I also want to be able to share them out with family or friends, or whoever.\n\n\nFor this first one, I figured I would start with something easy, and something that comes up through work a lot - just talking about how I got into the line of work that I'm in now. I now work at NASA as a product manager. I own a few of the products at the NASA Safety Center. That includes the NASA Mishap Information System and the NASA Cause Analysis Tool. These are all applications for safety personnel at NASA to use, mostly for data entry and storage for mishaps that happen at NASA. These could be anything from something as small as someone trips and falls, where we need a record of that injury even if it's just a skinned knee, all the way up to millions of dollars of property damage if we lose a satellite or something along those lines.\n\n\nI came from a computer science and software background in college and was a software engineer right out of college. But how about I start back at the beginning and talk about where things started, at least in my mind, and then progress through the windy road in my career to where I ended up.\n\n\nI wish I could hear more about other people in their career journeys, because I feel like every single person that I've talked to - when I asked them about where they are now and how they got there - almost nobody had just a clear vision and followed it to a T and knew exactly where they would be. It seems like everybody has this very windy, very interesting path where they're sort of going along slowly and finding their way. And that's how it happened for me, too.\n\n\n## The First Spark\n\n\nI think a good place to start would be sometime between when I was 7 or 16 years old. I would say I was probably around 11 when my dad bought me a Python programming book for kids. Which sounds like the perfect start to the story for someone in my line of work. But while I'm picking this as the beginning, it seemed, and I think really was, pretty inconsequential at the time because he bought me this book when I was 11, and I really just didn't care for it at all. It felt like more school to me, and I just wanted to go outside and play.\n\n\nI think I looked at it maybe three times. We might have attempted together to do the different coding exercises in the book - they had little games to show you how to code but also make it fun. I think maybe we did one of those, and then I thought, \"Man, screw this, I'm gonna go outside and play.\" So that was all that really was at that point in my life. But it's still something that I remember and think back on as maybe something that opened up my eyes and my mind to the possibility that coding is something that I could do.\n\n\n## First Jobs and High School\n\n\nFast forward to high school. It was time finally to get a job, and I had two places I was going to apply to. One was a little restaurant right down the road from my parents' place where I had applied to be a dishwasher. The other was Chipotle, where they just had some jobs that opened up. I don't remember exactly how it went, but I believe before I even had an offer at Chipotle, I called the restaurant right away and said, \"Hey, you know what? I'm not interested anymore. I'm going to go work at Chipotle.\" I basically broke up with them right then and there.\n\n\nI went and told my mom about it, and she was not happy because I had nothing solidified at that point. She said, \"You call them back right now and tell them that you're still interested in the job.\" So I very sheepishly got back on the phone, called that restaurant back, and asked if I could still be considered to work there. I don't remember if I had an offer at the time - I think I might have.\n\n\nThe way it ended up working out was that I did get a job at Chipotle Mexican Grill. I worked there through a lot of high school. I think it was my junior and senior year, and I think I came back maybe on one winter break in college as well.\n\n\nIt was an interesting place to work. Anyone who's been in food service will know it's hot and fast-paced. And I am not really a fast-paced person. As you can probably imagine, someone who takes time to sit slowly and write on a blog - I'm more in my head and like to really think through things and understand them. There's some of that working at Chipotle, but a lot of it was just \"get these burritos out and get them out fast.\" So it was an interesting time of my life. I enjoyed the people, and I definitely enjoyed sampling the food, but I could tell that wasn't anything I wanted to do long term.\n\n\n## College Decisions\n\n\nShortly before college, there's that period where you know college is ahead of you and you're trying to figure out what you want to be for the rest of your life. Who am I? Where am I going? Wrestling with all these big questions and trying to figure out what my major should be.\n\n\nI had already been thinking about something along the lines of psychology, and I think what probably got me there was being raised in the church and very much thinking about and constantly hearing messages about serving and helping other people. That was something that I felt called to, and I felt was really important and interesting. I didn't quite want to go into the church to be a pastor. It seemed weird to me to mix my income with my place of worship - it just wasn't something for me.\n\n\nSomething that further confirmed that idea of going into psychology was that our church actually did these surveys where it would give you recommendations about what your job would be. I took this survey and the three recommendations were: youth pastor, bartender, and psychologist. I already had decided I didn't want to do the youth pastor. The bartender - I thought, \"Oh, that's interesting, but I don't know if that's for me.\" And that kind of just confirmed further that maybe I should go and get a psychology degree.\n\n\n## Psychology to Programming\n\n\nSo I went to college for psychology for my first year. In the spring semester of that year, I got a job working as an undergraduate research assistant in a psychology lab. I went to Kent State University, and Manfred van Dolman had the Van Dolman lab. The general focus was romantic relationships, but I got to work on a bunch of interesting studies.\n\n\nI wasn't super involved - it was more so helping with data collection or running different sessions with participants. Some of the things I did: they would have couples go into a room by themselves and just answer questions together. Some of it was about splitting housework - how would they do that? Sometimes these were people who already lived together, sometimes it wasn't. They'd also dream about their future. One of my jobs was to just watch these recordings and transcribe them. This was before easy transcription services or AI, so I was just in there listening to all these conversations between my peers trying to figure out relationships.\n\n\nAnother study was an eye movement study, where I would bring participants into a room. We had a computer set up with a face harness in front of it so they would set their chin on there, kind of like if you go to the eye doctor. Right underneath or below the monitor, there was a camera that was positioned at their eyes. I would get that all configured with their eyes so I could figure out where they're looking on the screen, and then I would leave and just play some images up on the screen and see what they looked at. I think it was images either of males and females just alone or together as couples, and the study was trying to look at where you're looking - are you looking at the person's face, their body, something else?\n\n\nI didn't stay around at the lab long enough to find the results of that study, but that was another interesting one to be a part of. But part of working in that lab, one of the things I got to do that definitely led me to where I am now was data coding. All this data they would get at the end, I would have it in a big Excel sheet and aggregate it, and they had some program where they would analyze this data. The grad students had always done it pretty much manually, or they would have one of their undergrad research assistants do it manually, but I found that through this program, it had a little section where you could write scripts to automate some of the manual work that we were doing.\n\n\nSo I got to work figuring out how to do that and implemented it for the lab, which sped up the data analysis process for the whole lab, and for me too. I didn't have to sit there doing all this mindless work going through each data element and analyzing and coding and tagging each thing. That was maybe the first thing that really piqued my interest - like, \"Oh, this is really rewarding to be able to just write something on the computer, make the computer do things for me.\" It was just a small task that I could accomplish, and in the end, I can see that it worked, and now it's done. I found that really rewarding.\n\n\nI was doing that and enjoying it, but also while I was working in the lab, I was observing these grad students who were doing their research and just observing that I don't think this was the future for me. They were spending a lot of time in the lab. They seemed stressed. They were all working on their papers - I helped them some with their papers and references at the bottom and the slog of all of that and the research - and I just thought, \"Man, I don't know if this is for me, and if I can do this, and if this is what I want.\" Especially the way I was thinking of going, becoming an actual psychologist, it was almost guaranteed that I would need to go to some sort of graduate school, and just my undergraduate degree wouldn't get me very far.\n\n\n## Changing Direction\n\n\nSo thinking about what would come with having to go to grad school, as I neared the end of the semester and got into summer, I was like, \"Man, I really need to figure something else out because this is just not going to work for me.\" I was thinking, \"Well, if not psychology, what the heck do I do?\" because that was the plan that I went to college with, and I had nothing else in mind.\n\n\nBut then I thought back to the data coding in the lab that I enjoyed doing, which was basically just writing little scripts in Excel, and then I thought back to that Python book that my dad had got me when I was a kid, and how even though I paid no attention to it really at the time, it was memorable enough that it stuck with me even now. So I was like, \"I don't know. Maybe there's something here to explore.\"\n\n\nI think I went and looked for the Python book and never found it. I don't know if we donated the book or not. I don't know what ever happened to it. It's like a ghost. I really - maybe it didn't even happen, and I made the whole thing up. I'll have to double check with my dad. I'm pretty sure it's real, but I've never found the book. But it was memorable.\n\n\nSo that summer what I started to do was go on the internet and YouTube and just looked up like \"coding - where do you start? What is it? How does it work?\" and just started to play with it some myself just to figure out what it was about, what the possibilities were with the career. I had a lot of fun that summer making just some little tiny web projects, really nothing too fancy because I had no actual experience coding and didn't understand any of the basic fundamentals. I would just follow along precisely with what they were doing. It was probably really only HTML and CSS, so I'm not even programming, but just displaying a simple web page. But I had a lot of fun with that, just figuring out how to place the elements on the screen, style them, and make it all work together. I was like, \"Man, this is really cool.\"\n\n\n## Digital Sciences and First Internship\n\n\nSo I just went for it and switched my major. Kent State had something called digital sciences, which I appreciate. It was very similar to computer science, but you drop some of the high level calculus and more theoretical or sciency computer classes and trade them out for more cross-functional classes based on a focus area. So I was digital sciences with a focus on software development. The types of cross-functional courses I got to take: one was in requirements gathering - how do you do that and get requirements for a software project? I got to take a class on design, and a class on just building a web project together, which was really cool.\n\n\nWe built an XR mobile app. Kent State, if you don't know, had a really bad shooting back in the day, and they have all sorts of memorabilia or artifacts from that day archived back in a room. If you go request it, you can go see them - gas masks, bullet casings, and various things from that day. We got to go back into that room and see those, and we scanned them with a phone to make 3D digital artifacts. Through this app, we were able to display these 3D artifacts. We had these pedestals we set up in a room, we put QR codes on the pedestals, and then folks would come into the room, grab an iPad, and could point at the pedestal with the iPad. The pedestal was empty, kind of as an artistic representation of the lives that were lost, or the emptiness of that day, but you could still point your iPad at it and see this sort of ghostly 3D artifact rendering of different objects from that day, which was really cool. You could turn them around, and you could zoom in on them and take a look at them. It was opened up to the public so people could come in and see it, which they might not otherwise be able to get access to.\n\n\nThat was a cool project, and it was just things like that that I got to do with that digital sciences major, which I really appreciated, and I feel like prepared me probably better than a plain computer science degree would for the career I went into.\n\n\nIn college, I went for an internship at a place called Taazaa. I don't remember how I found them. They were a little custom software shop in Hudson, Ohio, where different businesses would work with them for some website or different software product they would need, and this place would work with them and help them build it out.\n\n\nI remember going to the interview for that internship, and typically for interviews for software engineering positions or technical positions, the interview will be very technical where they're asking you programming questions or almost like riddles to solve to make sure that you really understand technically what you're doing. They had some of those, and I'm sure they, knowing that it was an intern position, kept them simple. Thinking back on them, they were very easy things I could do with my eyes closed now - very simple sort or FizzBuzz type problems.\n\n\nBut that was after I think I did that interview after maybe one semester of college or one semester of that major in digital sciences, and really, no programming experience beyond that. So, even these simple questions, I just bombed that interview. It was so bad. I remember walking out of that and just feeling so despondent and dejected, so embarrassed that I had even shown up.\n\n\nThat was rough, but I don't know why, even still, I thought, \"You know what? Maybe there's some chance that I can get this thing\" because I think I did okay just talking to the guy and letting him know what I'm interested in, what I'm doing, and listening to what they're doing and asking questions. It took him a long time to get back to me. I followed up with him, maybe twice a week or every week, for multiple weeks, until eventually they got back to me and said, \"Hey, do you want the job?\" And I said, \"Oh my gosh, yeah, of course.\"\n\n\nAt some point, I asked him, \"Why me? Why did you give me that job because I feel like I did not do very good on the coding interview,\" and they said, \"You know what? You were the only person that followed up consistently. We had other people who did better on the technical interview, but they just didn't follow up, and we didn't see the same interest with them that you had.\"\n\n\nHearing that was another one of those things like the Python programming book that really stuck with me throughout my career and my life - just that value of persistence and interest and energy. I think having those things - almost everything else will work out if you have those things, and people will really pay attention to that.\n\n\nSo, that was sort of a pivotal moment for me, but the internship itself when I got into it - I really liked the people and the place, they had some interesting work, but honestly I feel bad because I probably just was not ready to be working somewhere at that point. They were very generous with allowing me to use a lot of the paid internship time in training classes on top of my college work, to figure out specific skills related to the work they were doing, to learn how to do it and build some of my own prototypes before building actual things for clients.\n\n\nI think I maybe did like one or two little pieces of a product for a client before I ended up leaving that internship, and I still feel bad. I left and got an internship at another place. I was there maybe eight months, and I could tell the look on their face when I said I was leaving. They were like, \"Are you serious? We spent all this time investing in you. Now, you're just gonna leave?\"\n\n\n## Progressive Insurance\n\n\nBut something better came along. I was at a career fair at Kent State, and I had actually just gone to see the Taazaa guys. They had a booth there, and I was just gonna walk there to go visit them and talk with them. But I had some classes or something, and I got there towards the end of the career fair, and they had already packed up and left. So I was like, \"Oh well, shoot, that stinks.\"\n\n\nSo I was walking out of the building, and then there was a Progressive Insurance booth. As I was walking by, one of them flagged me down and was like, \"Hey, want to hear about Progressive?\" And I was like, \"Oh yeah, sure, whatever, I got some time.\"\n\n\nSo I was talking to them. I told them about the internship I'm doing, the coursework I'm doing, what I'm interested in, and they were interested in having me back the next day. They would be doing interviews somewhere, and they invited me for an interview. I got in my resume, they invited me for interviews the next day, and I thought, \"All right, cool.\"\n\n\nSo I went and did the interview there, which went really well. I think maybe I did another interview that went well, and then I got invited to their final round of interviews, which - as a junior in college at this time, maybe a senior - it was just mind-boggling to me for a Fortune 100 company, the expenses they went through for interns even just at the interview stage.\n\n\nWhat ended up happening was all the candidates that had made it that far in the process, they brought us out to their headquarters. We were all local in the area, all college kids local. I don't think there was anyone outside of our commute, but they put us all up in a hotel. We got nice hotel rooms. They brought us onto their headquarters the next day. We got to tour around and see headquarters.\n\n\nProgressive actually owns the largest privately held collection of art in the country. The guy who founded it loved art and used it as an investment for the company, so they've got all these amazing artworks just around the walls all around the hallways of the headquarters building, so that was really cool and inspiring as a young college kid just walking around. They provided food. I was like, \"This is unreal. I cannot believe this is happening.\" And then they had a series of interviews throughout the day where you were interviewing with all sorts of different people. Then we left, and eventually I got a call back that I had gotten an internship there.\n\n\nThe way the internship worked was it started as a summer internship. They put us up in apartments - temporary apartments for the summer. We would live with some other interns, and that was great. I had a lot of fun living with the guys I lived with there who were also interning at Progressive.\n\n\nI learned a ton. The position was another software programmer position, working on claims software for Progressive - the software that claims reps use there. So, while not the most inspiring product to work on, the people and the culture of the company and the technology we got to work with - all that was amazing, so I had a lot of fun and learned a ton there. Progressive was great too, like the place before, about providing training, giving me that time to really learn.\n\n\nI think that is where my career really took off because that internship got extended into a further internship, or I think maybe it was a part-time job in my last semester of college. I really enjoyed it, and I really went all in on Progressive.\n\n\nIn college, I had that digital sciences major, but I also had a minor in Spanish. In high school, I had gone on a mission trip, a couple of mission trips actually, down to some Central American countries, and just fell in love with the culture and the language, so I was going for a Spanish minor. That last semester, man, it was loaded because I was trying to graduate a semester early. So I was really cramming things into my last semester. I had all my digital sciences stuff, which I had started on a year late because I started as a psych major. I had this Spanish minor that I had a few classes I had to take, and then I had that part-time job too.\n\n\nI was just like, \"You know what? I cannot do this.\" So I ended up dropping the Spanish minor with only two classes left to go. It still hurts a little bit, but the decision, and I still stick by it, was just - I don't think I really need or needed that piece of paper. All the lessons about the culture and all the language practice - I learned those either way, and I don't know what I would have done with the actual minor anyways. So that was my decision at the time. I dropped the minor. I still speak Spanish a little bit. We get these bilingual books for our daughter, so I have a lot of fun getting to kind of speak Spanish to her and hopefully teach her some of that.\n\n\nProgressive was great. I had that part-time job, which then went to their associate programmer, which was the lowest level, and then worked up to their mid-level programmer and was moving up really quick. I was learning a lot. I was taking on a lot of responsibility, doing a lot of extra things above my level. And I think that was seen, but also just working in a large company like that, there's a lot of processes and bureaucracy involved with moving up and rotating through promotions.\n\n\nI had been talking with my manager for a while and was on track to get to their senior programmer level, but it just felt like it was taking a long time. They're like, \"Oh, we gotta give this other person this thing first, and we've got you on the list. You're gonna get to that senior programmer position. I have your name on the list, but we just gotta wait till it's the right time.\"\n\n\nI was frustrated with that, even though I loved the company. It just felt like I was progressing very quickly, and there just wasn't really room for me to grow or places for me to go. So I started looking for other jobs, and honestly, I wasn't looking very seriously. I had no intention of leaving Progressive, but I was feeling a little frustrated, and I just thought, \"You know what? Let me interview at some other companies for these more senior positions, just to see how it goes and learn what the interview process is like, get some practice with it again\" because I hadn't interviewed for a couple years at that point.\n\n\nMy criteria was, I would look for jobs that I would not think I would actually get an offer for. But if I did, I would consider taking it because I didn't want to just apply places where I knew if I got the offer, I'd tell the place no, and screw a bunch of companies by doing that. So I thought, \"You know what? I'll just shoot for the stars. Go for places where I don't think that I'd get the job, but get some practice interviewing there, and get some feedback about what I'm missing, or what I could do better.\"\n\n\n## NASA\n\n\nI applied to a few places. I think I got an offer at one that I turned down, and then I saw this NASA job come up, and this one I really, really did not think I was qualified for. I only applied because of the name on it was NASA. So I was like, \"Man, how cool would it be to go and work at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration?\"\n\n\nThe job was very much a diagonal career move because it was a step up in seniority for sure from what I was doing at the time, and also a horizontal move, meaning it was very different work from what I was doing. My role at Progressive, I very much was a programmer day-to-day, writing code, building software applications directly, whereas this NASA job was more managing the work rather than doing the work. So it was a lot of oversight into the technical infrastructure of the team, helping the dev team with their processes, and how they're writing code. At that point, it was less product management, but doing a little bit of product management too - working with stakeholders, gathering requirements, and instead of just building the thing, figuring out what needed to be built and how we would build it instead of just taking orders and building whatever little piece I was told to do.\n\n\nThat was scary but interesting to me. So I went ahead and applied, and I genuinely did not think at all that I would get the offer. But I went through an initial interview, where they had some questions beforehand, I think about, \"Hey, you've got these different projects with competing priorities. How would you handle it?\" or \"You've got this new application with these requirements. What kind of technology would you build it in? How would you architect it?\"\n\n\nI liked that they would take home questions because I got to really research. I mean, I spent a lot of time building out a system diagram for this hypothetical system that they asked me about. I think they liked the time that I spent on it. After the fact, after I got the job, they said, \"Yeah, I don't think anyone else spent that much time on it. Yours were for sure the most detailed answers,\" which I think just goes back to that persistence and energy that I had learned earlier in life.\n\n\nI got called back for another interview, and even though I felt like the interviews and everything were going well, I was just like, \"Man, I don't know. All these people I'm talking to with this job are a lot older than me. The people who would be my peers, a lot of people are 15, 20 years older than me,\" and I just thought for sure I was gonna get passed up, just due to inexperience, which I wouldn't have faulted them for at all.\n\n\nBut I got a call one day that I had gotten the job and was just floored and shocked by it, and really couldn't believe it. I remember getting onboarded. My manager at the time, Irene, I remember having a conversation with her before I really started, where she was like, \"You know, you are younger than a lot of people that work here.\" And I said, \"Oh yeah, yeah, I know, I figured, I'm aware.\" And she said, \"Just feel like you'll handle that okay? If there's some folks who... there might be just a few folks who are not happy with that,\" just letting me know that there might be some challenges specifically related to that. And I said, \"You know what? No problem. I'm game for it. I'll figure that out.\"\n\n\nBut I do have to say that first year, maybe a year and a half, was a more difficult part of my career, because not necessarily with anyone I worked with directly or other civil servants on my team, but I did feel some of that of, like, \"Who is this kid coming in here and trying to tell us how to work, help us work better, telling us what to do,\" which I wasn't necessarily doing. But I was coming in and trying to change some things and make things better. So I think very much there was this perception of \"Who is this kid? Who let him in here?\"\n\n\n## Growing at NASA\n\n\nI actually got a really good clear view of that. I went through this NASA leadership program, which was amazing. It was kind of a select group they picked from. I think a little over 300 people across the agency applied, and they picked 60. I made it in, and that was so cool because we got to travel to all these different centers and learn about the mission and hear from different NASA leadership.\n\n\nThe part of it I want to share is they did these different feedback assessments or surveys. One was called a 360 feedback assessment, where you were asking everyone around you to give you feedback. At the time that I applied to this leadership program, I'd only been with the agency like a month or two. So by the time I was sending out the feedback assessment, I hadn't even been there a year yet. I was still pretty fresh, getting feedback from people around me, and I couldn't see who specifically, but I had it split up where I could see feedback from civil servants versus feedback from contractors.\n\n\nFrom the contract side, I got some feedback that was pretty rough. I think some people might not have realized that the feedback goes directly to me. I think they might have thought that it goes to my supervisor because it was more worded towards a supervisor, like, \"I don't know why we hired this guy because he doesn't seem like he has a lot of experience, and I have not worked with him enough to know to see if it's gonna work out, and I don't think it's going to. And I think we should have hired someone else.\"\n\n\nEspecially as someone who had that concern coming into the job, that was a day when I got that feedback where I just thought, \"Oh, that was rough to hear and to receive.\" That whole first year, it was a big transition. It felt like I had taken on a lot all in one bite. Despite it being difficult, I am proud of myself for having worked through that because I think now I'm in a really good place where I've built trust with my team and work well with them and really enjoy the work and enjoy the people too.\n\n\n## Where I Am Now\n\n\nEspecially the more product side - I'm glad I made that jump. I do miss some of the programming and writing code, and I scratch that itch by doing some side projects that I work on. I miss writing code a little bit, but I really enjoy having that bigger picture, getting to make decisions myself. I think what it was before, while it's really rewarding to work on a little piece of code and then be done and see it work, it was more like, \"Hey, here's what you're gonna build. Now, go build it.\"\n\n\nI like being on the other side and being able to implement with my team - not just being like, \"Hey, here's what you're gonna go build, go build it.\" I mean, sometimes that's the case if it's just a really small, simple thing, but really bringing in my team - bringing in the design side and the developer side and us figuring out together the best way to build something. That has been really rewarding, to maybe make that work even better than ways I had seen before.\n\n\nI love that big picture product strategy work. I've gotten to do some zero-to-one work, like for the NASA Cause Analysis Tool that we built - that did not exist and was a new product we were building. That was a lot of fun to stand up from the ground up and talk with mishap investigators all across the agency and various other people and roles that do root cause analysis to understand, \"Hey, what do you guys really need? How do you work? What does it look like right now?\" I got to see all these different, crazy convoluted processes people do right now, and figure out what they need and turn that into a product they can really use.\n\n\nWe launched that back in March of last year, and we rolled it out iteratively. We rolled out a really small version of it and slowly built on it over time. But even with the limited set of functionality we've released, people are using it and finding it useful and enjoying it.\n\n\n## Wrapping Up\n\n\nSo that's a look at how I got where I am. I just arrived at work for the day and parked in my parking spot. So who knows, this might be the last car post I ever do, but I enjoyed it as a way to just stay busy during the commute. Usually, I'm listening to a podcast or audiobook. I've been on a history kick recently. I just finished \"1776\" by David McCullough and then just started \"John Adams,\" which is also by David McCullough, but that one has felt a little drier, which is why I think I wanted to do this car post today. I was like, \"You know what? I need to switch it up and do something different.\"\n\n\nI think at the top of the article, I'm going to try to put up a clip of the audio so you can listen to it if you want. The clip of the audio might end up being different to the text. I think what I'm going to try to do is just use Google Recorder, the recorder app just on my phone to record this, and it makes a transcript live. I think I'll just post the audio clip, but I'll take the transcript, and I think I'm just going to dump the whole thing into AI and be like, \"Hey, fix all the grammatical errors and maybe separate some of this, so it's not just one long blurb of me talking.\"\n\n\nSo the audio won't probably won't perfectly match the text, but I'm curious to try that out and kind of see how it goes. If it feels like it's modifying my words too much, I'll just post the raw thing up there because I don't want it to be too different from what I've been talking about.\n\n\nAnyways, I'm rambling at this point. It's been good talking into my phone for this car ride, and if you read this far, thank you, because this has been a long time of just talking.\n",

				"title": "Targeted by Trump and Musk - On Being a Federal Employee",
				"content_html": "<p>In my <a href=\"https://weidok.al/2025/01/20/weeknotes-vol.html\">weeknotes post from January 20, 2025</a>, hours before the inauguration ceremony of Donald Trump, I wrote about being uncertain about what a Trump presidency would hold for me as a federal employee.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>While government efficiency sounds good (who wouldn‚Äôt want that?), it seems like part of the plan is to make things tougher for federal employees. Including return to office mandates, layoffs, worse retirement/insurance benefits, and more. As a federal employee, that does not sound appealing. I am curious to see how much of it is talk, or frivolous bills that go nowhere in congress, and how much of it ends up becoming real and impacting my life.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But the speed and scale of change that I&rsquo;ve seen in the past month has far exceeded what I thought possible. That we have a president biased for action is indisputable. It&rsquo;s a stark contrast from the previous presidency. What&rsquo;s yet to be seen is the lasting effect this flurry of actions will have on our government, and therefore, our nation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"disruptive-emails\">Disruptive Emails</h2>\n<p>Nine days after writing that post, two disruptive emails found their way into my inbox on the same day.</p>\n<h3 id=\"return-to-in-person-work\">Return to In-Person Work</h3>\n<p>The less interesting of the two was an email from NASA HR with the subject &ldquo;<strong>Instructions for returning to in-person work</strong>&rdquo;. I knew this would come, but never expected it this quickly. All NASA employees, with few exceptions, will be back onsite full-time starting February 28. That includes me. In the past weeks I&rsquo;ve been involved in more than a few discussions about how we are going to make it work to come back onsite.</p>\n<p>My organization, the NASA Safety Center, went all-in on the shift to hybrid work post-Covid. We sold about half of our office space. Almost everybody gave up their seat assignments, and the floor plan was reconfigured to optimize for &ldquo;hoteling&rdquo;. This allowed people to reserve a cubicle or pick from unoccupied desks in an open seating area. It worked great when we only needed to come in once a week. But now we are scrambling to reverse course.</p>\n<p>We have <em>just</em> enough space to accommodate our 30+ civil servants. The team is scrambling to figure out who gets which seats, and coordinating everyone bringing in our NASA-provided IT equipment that we have been using at home for the past few years. On top of that, we don&rsquo;t have space for the contractor staff we work with closely on a day-to-day basis. We sold that space years ago and the team has grown since then. Contractors are not mandated to return to office under the executive order, so for now we are figuring out how to get all the civil servants back, and then we will figure out what to do with our contractors. We all have worked very effectively from home the past few years, so I believe (and hope) we will offer the contractors more leniency than we have received.</p>\n<p>The intent behind the return to office is to get federal workers to quit (<a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/opinion/musk-and-ramaswamy-the-doge-plan-to-reform-government-supreme-court-guidance-end-executive-power-grab-fa51c020\">Elon and Vivek said this publicly in an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal last year</a>), so I don&rsquo;t think that is the correct approach to take with our contractors unless we also want to them to quit. And we do not want that.</p>\n<p>Beyond the professional complexities of bringing everyone back to the office, I am saddened about needing to make this change for my family. I will miss the ten hours a week I will lose with my family due to my commute. I&rsquo;ll certainly miss eating lunch with my wife and daughter, going on post-lunch walks, and being able to put my daughter down for her naps. I still feel incredibly fortunate for the job I have and a commute to the office doesn&rsquo;t change that, but this marks a stark change in routine and lifestyle, for myself and my family.</p>\n<p>Not being one to wallow, I have been trying to focus on the silver linings. I&rsquo;ll get to connect with my coworkers more. I can become a voracious audiobook listener on my drives. My desk can be the home of a &ldquo;joke of the week&rdquo; board that becomes a small part of rebuilding office morale. Focusing on these potential positives has made it a little easier to accept that I&rsquo;ll be back in the office full-time soon.</p>\n<p>This change came fast and heavy. While I&rsquo;m going to make the best of it, this is going to be a tough transition for my team and me. Yet despite the turmoil this has caused, the return to office email has taken up far less space in my conscience than the other email that graced my inbox on January 29.</p>\n<h3 id=\"fork-in-the-road-deferred-resignation\">Fork in the Road (Deferred Resignation)</h3>\n<p>This other email came from a curious new sender that just said &ldquo;HR&rdquo; and had the subject &ldquo;Fork in the Road&rdquo;. It was marked as [EXTERNAL], which is an immediate red flag, and had no branding. If one was to craft the perfect spam email, this is the template they would follow.</p>\n<p>But this was real.</p>\n<p>This email came from <a href=\"mailto:hr@opm.gov\">hr@opm.gov</a>. An email address that did not exist a week prior.</p>\n<p>In the days leading up to this email, we had received two other emails from this address stating that the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) was testing a new government-wide email system. These messages were sent to all 2+ million federal employees.</p>\n<p>But on February 29, we all got to see <em>why</em> this new email system had been set up. The Fork in the Road email introduced a program called Deferred Resignation. If you opted in to the program, you would agree to resign effective September 30, 2025. In return, you could work from home until your resignation date, and your agency <em>may</em> put you on administrative leave, effectively allowing you to receive your paycheck without working.</p>\n<p>How would one enroll in this program, you ask? Respond to the email with the word RESIGN. That&rsquo;s it. Yes, seriously. No, I&rsquo;m not kidding.</p>\n<p>If you want to see for yourself, <a href=\"https://garden.weidok.al/fork-in-the-road-email/\">you can read the email here</a>. I saved my own copy in case OPM ever takes it down from their website, which they&rsquo;ve done with a couple of things over the past few weeks.</p>\n<p>Now you might be wondering, &ldquo;Jake, did you take this!? Eight months of pay!? You could take a long vacation and find a new job!&rdquo;</p>\n<p>No. I did not take this offer. I don&rsquo;t trust it.</p>\n<p>There are a few reasons why I don&rsquo;t trust it. For starters, this email curiously has the same title as an email that Musk sent to Twitter employees when he took over there. What happened to Twitter employees who accepted the severance offer? <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/02/05/nx-s1-5286477/fork-in-the-road-twitter-federal-workers\">They were not paid what they were promised</a>.  If that&rsquo;s not enough, it&rsquo;s also not clear that OPM/Trump/Musk have the authority to make this offer. The federal government is only funded through March 14. Congress needs to pass a new budget by then, and it&rsquo;s possible that they will not include appropriations for the people who took deferred resignation. And in addition to the budget, current federal law limits agencies to giving no more than 10 days of admin leave.</p>\n<p>All of these are, in my opinion, good reasons to be skeptical of the offer.</p>\n<p>But there&rsquo;s more.</p>\n<p>A few days later, OPM sent a template Deferred Resignation agreement to agencies that had additional language about how the program would work. The language in the agreement is concerning. <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jYt1AtoWlG0yPBVoGZw4ttwerpNNCyFp/view?usp=drive_link\">Here&rsquo;s a copy of the template agreement</a>.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ll point out a few of the most concerning clauses, emphasis mine.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Employee shall not be expected to work during the deferred resignation period except in rare circumstances as determined by [AGENCY].</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what constitutes rare circumstances. We&rsquo;ve already seen some cases of employees still being required to work, such as IRS employees through tax return season. Another section reads:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>By signing this agreement, the parties acknowledge that they have entered the agreement knowingly, voluntarily, and <strong>free from improper influence, coercion, or duress</strong>. Employee understands that, except as provided in paragraph 14 applicable to Employees 40 years of age or older, this agreement <strong>cannot be rescinded, except in the sole discretion of the [AGENCY HEAD], which shall not be subject to review at the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) or any other forum, and waives all rights to challenge the resignation before the MSPB or any other forum.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>First, I wouldn&rsquo;t say this offer is &ldquo;free from improper influence, coercion, or duress&rdquo;. The original fork email states that they intend to eliminate positions, and they cannot promise anyone who does not take this offer that they will still have a job. Further, this template agreement came out two days before the deadline to resign. A 48 hour timeframe might cause some duress for a big life decision like this.</p>\n<p>But the second part I emphasized is much more concerning. In plain English, the Agency Head can undo this agreement whenever they want, and the employee gives up their right to do anything about it. In summary, this agreement binds the employee to its terms, but it does not bind the agency to its terms.</p>\n<p>But wait! There&rsquo;s even more waiving of rights in here:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Employee <strong>forever waives</strong>, and will not pursue through any judicial, administrative, or other process, <strong>any action against [AGENCY]</strong> that is based on, arising from, or related to Employee‚Äôs employment at [AGENCY] or the deferred resignation offer, including any and all claims that were or could have been brought concerning said matters. This waiver includes all claims Employee may have under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act. Employee <strong>unconditionally releases [AGENCY]</strong> and its present and former employees, officers, agents, representatives, and all persons acting by, through, or in concert with any of those individuals, either in their official or individual capacities, <strong>from any and all liability</strong> based on, arising from, or relating to the matters that Employee may have against them, including any and all claims that were or could have been brought. Consistent with applicable law, Employee similarly <strong>waives any claim that could be brought on Employee‚Äôs behalf by another entity, including Employee‚Äôs labor union.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Wow. That clause is not typical in the other forms related to separating from the government. I wonder why they wanted to add that in for the Deferred Resignation? Perhaps they anticipate a decent amount of people taking legal action related to this program?</p>\n<p>Hopefully you can understand why I chose not to take the Deferred Resignation.</p>\n<p>Another funny twist in this story is that the day of the deadline, February 6, I got an urgent email from leadership that the deadline was midnight and there would be NO EXTENSIONS. Then an hour and a half later, I got an email that the deadline had been extended, because a judge put a temporary restraining order on the program until they could have a full hearing on it.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, the case was thrown out because it had been brought by the federal labor unions, and the judge ruled that the unions did not have standing since they are not harmed by the offer.</p>\n<p>Despite all the concerning points I highlighted above, NASA had about 800+ people on the list for deferred resignation. But here&rsquo;s the thing: when OPM compiled and sent the list to NASA, they accidentally included more than just the actual respondents. The count got inflated by supervisors who were cc&rsquo;d on emails, out-of-office replies to the &ldquo;Fork in the Road&rdquo; message, and others who had no plans to resign.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s worth noting that many who have taken the offer were already planning to retire or very near retirement. From what I&rsquo;m hearing, that seems to be the vast majority.</p>\n<h2 id=\"further-shrinking-the-workforce\">Further Shrinking the Workforce</h2>\n<p>Beyond the Return to Office and the Deferred Resignation Program, there have been a few other attempts to downsize the federal workforce including eliminating DEI positions, firing probationary employees, and beginning preparations for a reduction in force (RIF).</p>\n<h3 id=\"eliminating-dei\">Eliminating DEI</h3>\n<p>In compliance with the executive order &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/ending-radical-and-wasteful-government-dei-programs-and-preferencing/\">Ending Radical And Wasteful Government DEI Programs And Preferencing</a>&rdquo;, NASA eliminated all functions and people whose primary focus was DEI. I think only a couple of people fit this description at NASA, but there&rsquo;s been a further effort to remove all language related to DEI from all employee performance plans.</p>\n<h4 id=\"eliminating-gender\">Eliminating Gender</h4>\n<p>In addition to eliminating those positions and modifying performance plans, there were other changes mandated in a separate but related order titled &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/defending-women-from-gender-ideology-extremism-and-restoring-biological-truth-to-the-federal-government/\">DEFENDING WOMEN FROM GENDER IDEOLOGY EXTREMISM AND RESTORING BIOLOGICAL TRUTH TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT</a>&rdquo;, such as replacing the word &ldquo;gender&rdquo; with &ldquo;sex&rdquo; in government forms and communications. I was tasked with making sure this change was made in one of our software applications that tracks mishaps. When someone is injured, we would collect their &ldquo;gender&rdquo; in the application, but had to change the name of that question to &ldquo;sex&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>It was a trivial change to make. But it was strange to see everybody so nervous about getting it done by the deadline, all the way up to my boss&rsquo;s boss&rsquo;s boss. Even seemingly minor orders create intense pressure, with tight deadlines, unclear consequences for noncompliance, and widespread fear of job loss.</p>\n<h3 id=\"firing-probationary-employees\">Firing Probationary Employees</h3>\n<p>When someone gets hired into the federal workforce, they start in a &ldquo;probationary&rdquo; period for the first year or two, depending on the position and agency. This is intended as a trial period, where the agency has more freedom to separate the employee within the probationary period if their performance does not meet the requirements of their position.</p>\n<p>What we&rsquo;re seeing now is an unprecedented use of the probationary period. Probationary employees are being <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/saradorn/2025/02/21/heres-where-trumps-government-layoffs-are-fema-irs-tsa-and-more/\">fired en masse at multiple federal agencies</a>. This is almost certainly illegal, because the intent is that probationary employees can be separated without severance or appeal <em><strong>for performance reasons</strong></em>. It will be interesting to see how this plays out in court, because many of those fired were given a generic reasoning of their termination being &ldquo;for performance reasons&rdquo; despite having stellar performance reviews and/or awards.</p>\n<p>Luckily, NASA has been spared from these probationary firings for now. It was a dramatic week though, with rumors that firings would happen Tuesday, then <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/02/nasa-receives-11th-hour-reprieve-from-probationary-employee-cuts/\">rumors that it was paused by the White House</a>, then rumors that it would happen Friday, then nothing except <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/20/science/nasa-layoffs-workforce-firings/index.html#:~:text=NASA%20says%20job%20cuts%20for,Washington%2C%20DC%2C%20in%202023.\">a statement from NASA that any probationary firings would be for performance reasons</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"reduction-in-force\">Reduction in Force</h2>\n<p>One of the more recent executive orders is titled &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/implementing-the-presidents-department-of-government-efficiency-workforce-optimization-initiative/\">Implementing The President‚Äôs ‚ÄúDepartment of Government Efficiency‚Äù Workforce Optimization</a>&rdquo;. This executive order calls for a reduction in force across the federal government. Some of the language in the order has caused a lot of concern, such as:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Agency Heads shall promptly undertake preparations to initiate large-scale reductions in force (RIFs), consistent with applicable law, and <em><strong>to separate from Federal service temporary employees</strong></em> and reemployed annuitants working in areas that will likely be subject to the RIFs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I was hired in as a temporary employee, but luckily was converted to permanent last year. But I work with a few temporary employees who fear for their jobs based on the way this is worded. If this is carried out as-worded, it would impact a large chunk of NASA&rsquo;s workforce. Here&rsquo;s another concerning section:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>All offices that perform functions not mandated by statute or other law shall be prioritized in the RIFs, including all agency diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives; all agency initiatives, components, or operations that my Administration suspends or closes; and <em><strong>all components and employees performing functions not mandated by statute or other law who are not typically designated as essential during a lapse in appropriations</strong></em> as provided in the Agency Contingency Plans on the Office of Management and Budget website.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I don&rsquo;t understand how all employees not designated as essential during a lapse in appropriations should be prioritized in RIFs. At NASA, that&rsquo;s more than 90% of the workforce. When the government shuts down, it&rsquo;s pretty much just security and facility/IT maintenance who still come in to make sure things don&rsquo;t break or get stolen. I can&rsquo;t imagine this actually being implemented as it is worded, but the wording is causing a lot of confusion and frustration at NASA.</p>\n<p>So far, the reduction hasn&rsquo;t actually begun, but agencies are planning for it. This will take time, but I have no idea what the breadth or scope of the reductions in force will be. I could lose my job from this, but there is no way to tell for sure right now. It helps that I was converted to a permanent position last year, but it doesn&rsquo;t help that I only have 3 years of federal service and do not have a veteran status.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-latest-elon-email\">The Latest Elon Email</h2>\n<p>Yesterday, Saturday, February 22, all federal employees received an email titled &ldquo;What did you do last week?&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>The email reads:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Please reply to this email with approx. 5 bullets of what you accomplished last week and cc your manager.</p>\n<p>Please do not send any classified information, links, or attachments.</p>\n<p>Deadline is this Monday at 11:59pmEST.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Viewed in isolation, that&rsquo;s weird, but not terrible. What makes it much more malicious is this tweet from Elon <strong>before this email was sent:</strong>*</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>I don&rsquo;t see any way it would be legal for a non-response to be equivalent to an employee submitting their resignation. It&rsquo;s hard to believe these are official government communications being sent to 2+ million federal workers.</p>\n<p>What&rsquo;s further frustrating is that OPM doesn&rsquo;t have the authority to ask for something like this.</p>\n<p>I plan not to respond unless I receive a direct order from NASA to respond.</p>\n<p>The invisible subtext behind this email is offensive. It seems to say &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t believe you accomplished much of anything last week. Justify yourself to us, or resign.&rdquo; At the very least, this administration is clearly flexing its muscles and attempting to force federal workers to comply with its untraditional demands.</p>\n<p>While I hesitate to make such a strong analogy, I can&rsquo;t help but be reminded of the stories of German policemen in &ldquo;Ordinary Men&rdquo;. They ended up committing atrocities they could never imagine, but were led to that place slowly by continually complying to small, seemingly innocuous orders. I can&rsquo;t help but wonder if these little orders are meant to condition me into a similar place of compliance and submission. The thought of that repulses me, but it is in the back of my mind with each new directive that comes out.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whats-next\">What&rsquo;s Next?</h2>\n<p>Nobody knows for certain what comes next, but it seems pretty clear that it won&rsquo;t be anything good, at least from the perspective of a federal employee. We know we have the reduction in force to look forward to. I&rsquo;m certain we&rsquo;ll get some more Elon-inspired emails sent to the whole government. NASA has a DOGE rep installed at headquarters now, but I&rsquo;m not sure exactly what they&rsquo;ll be doing. The word is that they&rsquo;re looking for contracts to cut. And the &ldquo;Fork in the Road&rdquo; email hinted that the performance ratings process will become more rigorous.</p>\n<p>On March 14 government funding expires. I am not sure whether to expect a government shutdown or congress to pass a budget. If they do pass a budget, I suspect there will be new legislation included that will adversely affect federal employees. <a href=\"https://www.afge.org/article/124-billion-in-federal-benefits-on-house-republicans-chopping-block/\">Recent proposed legislation has suggested cuts to federal employee benefits</a>.</p>\n<p>Beyond that, who knows. In the meantime, I will be getting my work done and doing my best to ignore all the noise this is causing. I hope to be a calming presence for my coworkers in the midst of all the chaos and fear. As a Christian, this is a good opportunity for me to &ldquo;love my neighbors&rdquo;, especially as so much animosity is being directed at them.</p>\n<p>I also plan to keep this post updated at the bottom with any new things that happen, mostly as a reference for myself so I can look back someday and remember how wild things were as a fed back in 2025.</p>\n<h2 id=\"updates\">Updates</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Feb 24, 2025: <a href=\"https://weidok.al/2025/02/24/no-need-to-read-between.html\">Trump and Musk mock federal workers with memes.</a></li>\n</ul>\n",
				"content_text": "In my [weeknotes post from January 20, 2025](https://weidok.al/2025/01/20/weeknotes-vol.html), hours before the inauguration ceremony of Donald Trump, I wrote about being uncertain about what a Trump presidency would hold for me as a federal employee.\r\n\r\n> While government efficiency sounds good (who wouldn‚Äôt want that?), it seems like part of the plan is to make things tougher for federal employees. Including return to office mandates, layoffs, worse retirement/insurance benefits, and more. As a federal employee, that does not sound appealing. I am curious to see how much of it is talk, or frivolous bills that go nowhere in congress, and how much of it ends up becoming real and impacting my life.\r\n\r\nBut the speed and scale of change that I've seen in the past month has far exceeded what I thought possible. That we have a president biased for action is indisputable. It's a stark contrast from the previous presidency. What's yet to be seen is the lasting effect this flurry of actions will have on our government, and therefore, our nation.\r\n\r\n## Disruptive Emails\r\n\r\nNine days after writing that post, two disruptive emails found their way into my inbox on the same day.\r\n### Return to In-Person Work\r\n\r\nThe less interesting of the two was an email from NASA HR with the subject \"**Instructions for returning to in-person work**\". I knew this would come, but never expected it this quickly. All NASA employees, with few exceptions, will be back onsite full-time starting February 28. That includes me. In the past weeks I've been involved in more than a few discussions about how we are going to make it work to come back onsite.\r\n\r\nMy organization, the NASA Safety Center, went all-in on the shift to hybrid work post-Covid. We sold about half of our office space. Almost everybody gave up their seat assignments, and the floor plan was reconfigured to optimize for \"hoteling\". This allowed people to reserve a cubicle or pick from unoccupied desks in an open seating area. It worked great when we only needed to come in once a week. But now we are scrambling to reverse course.\r\n\r\nWe have *just* enough space to accommodate our 30+ civil servants. The team is scrambling to figure out who gets which seats, and coordinating everyone bringing in our NASA-provided IT equipment that we have been using at home for the past few years. On top of that, we don't have space for the contractor staff we work with closely on a day-to-day basis. We sold that space years ago and the team has grown since then. Contractors are not mandated to return to office under the executive order, so for now we are figuring out how to get all the civil servants back, and then we will figure out what to do with our contractors. We all have worked very effectively from home the past few years, so I believe (and hope) we will offer the contractors more leniency than we have received.\r\n\r\nThe intent behind the return to office is to get federal workers to quit ([Elon and Vivek said this publicly in an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal last year](https://www.wsj.com/opinion/musk-and-ramaswamy-the-doge-plan-to-reform-government-supreme-court-guidance-end-executive-power-grab-fa51c020)), so I don't think that is the correct approach to take with our contractors unless we also want to them to quit. And we do not want that.\r\n\r\nBeyond the professional complexities of bringing everyone back to the office, I am saddened about needing to make this change for my family. I will miss the ten hours a week I will lose with my family due to my commute. I'll certainly miss eating lunch with my wife and daughter, going on post-lunch walks, and being able to put my daughter down for her naps. I still feel incredibly fortunate for the job I have and a commute to the office doesn't change that, but this marks a stark change in routine and lifestyle, for myself and my family.\r\n\r\nNot being one to wallow, I have been trying to focus on the silver linings. I'll get to connect with my coworkers more. I can become a voracious audiobook listener on my drives. My desk can be the home of a \"joke of the week\" board that becomes a small part of rebuilding office morale. Focusing on these potential positives has made it a little easier to accept that I'll be back in the office full-time soon.\r\n\r\nThis change came fast and heavy. While I'm going to make the best of it, this is going to be a tough transition for my team and me. Yet despite the turmoil this has caused, the return to office email has taken up far less space in my conscience than the other email that graced my inbox on January 29.\r\n\r\n### Fork in the Road (Deferred Resignation)\r\n\r\nThis other email came from a curious new sender that just said \"HR\" and had the subject \"Fork in the Road\". It was marked as [EXTERNAL], which is an immediate red flag, and had no branding. If one was to craft the perfect spam email, this is the template they would follow.\r\n\r\nBut this was real.\r\n\r\nThis email came from hr@opm.gov. An email address that did not exist a week prior.\r\n\r\nIn the days leading up to this email, we had received two other emails from this address stating that the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) was testing a new government-wide email system. These messages were sent to all 2+ million federal employees.\r\n\r\nBut on February 29, we all got to see *why* this new email system had been set up. The Fork in the Road email introduced a program called Deferred Resignation. If you opted in to the program, you would agree to resign effective September 30, 2025. In return, you could work from home until your resignation date, and your agency *may* put you on administrative leave, effectively allowing you to receive your paycheck without working.\r\n\r\nHow would one enroll in this program, you ask? Respond to the email with the word RESIGN. That's it. Yes, seriously. No, I'm not kidding.\r\n\r\nIf you want to see for yourself, [you can read the email here](https://garden.weidok.al/fork-in-the-road-email/). I saved my own copy in case OPM ever takes it down from their website, which they've done with a couple of things over the past few weeks.\r\n\r\nNow you might be wondering, \"Jake, did you take this!? Eight months of pay!? You could take a long vacation and find a new job!\"\r\n\r\nNo. I did not take this offer. I don't trust it.\r\n\r\nThere are a few reasons why I don't trust it. For starters, this email curiously has the same title as an email that Musk sent to Twitter employees when he took over there. What happened to Twitter employees who accepted the severance offer? [They were not paid what they were promised](https://www.npr.org/2025/02/05/nx-s1-5286477/fork-in-the-road-twitter-federal-workers).

Congress needs to pass a new budget by then, and it's possible that they will not include appropriations for the people who took deferred resignation. And in addition to the budget, current federal law limits agencies to giving no more than 10 days of admin leave.\r\n\r\nAll of these are, in my opinion, good reasons to be skeptical of the offer.\r\n\r\nBut there's more.\r\n\r\nA few days later, OPM sent a template Deferred Resignation agreement to agencies that had additional language about how the program would work. The language in the agreement is concerning. [Here's a copy of the template agreement](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jYt1AtoWlG0yPBVoGZw4ttwerpNNCyFp/view?usp=drive_link).\r\n\r\nI'll point out a few of the most concerning clauses, emphasis mine.\r\n\r\n> Employee shall not be expected to work during the deferred resignation period except in rare circumstances as determined by [AGENCY].\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what constitutes rare circumstances. We've already seen some cases of employees still being required to work, such as IRS employees through tax return season.

The original fork email states that they intend to eliminate positions, and they cannot promise anyone who does not take this offer that they will still have a job. Further, this template agreement came out two days before the deadline to resign. A 48 hour timeframe might cause some duress for a big life decision like this.\r\n\r\nBut the second part I emphasized is much more concerning.

This waiver includes all claims Employee may have under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act. Employee **unconditionally releases [AGENCY]** and its present and former employees, officers, agents, representatives, and all persons acting by, through, or in concert with any of those individuals, either in their official or individual capacities, **from any and all liability** based on, arising from, or relating to the matters that Employee may have against them, including any and all claims that were or could have been brought. Consistent with applicable law, Employee similarly **waives any claim that could be brought on Employee‚Äôs behalf by another entity, including Employee‚Äôs labor union.**\r\n\r\nWow. That clause is not typical in the other forms related to separating from the government. I wonder why they wanted to add that in for the Deferred Resignation? Perhaps they anticipate a decent amount of people taking legal action related to this program?\r\n\r\nHopefully you can understand why I chose not to take the Deferred Resignation.\r\n\r\nAnother funny twist in this story is that the day of the deadline, February 6, I got an urgent email from leadership that the deadline was midnight and there would be NO EXTENSIONS. Then an hour and a half later, I got an email that the deadline had been extended, because a judge put a temporary restraining order on the program until they could have a full hearing on it.\r\n\r\nUltimately, the case was thrown out because it had been brought by the federal labor unions, and the judge ruled that the unions did not have standing since they are not harmed by the offer.\r\n\r\nDespite all the concerning points I highlighted above, NASA had about 800+ people on the list for deferred resignation. But here's the thing: when OPM compiled and sent the list to NASA, they accidentally included more than just the actual respondents. The count got inflated by supervisors who were cc'd on emails, out-of-office replies to the \"Fork in the Road\" message, and others who had no plans to resign.\r\n\r\nIt's worth noting that many who have taken the offer were already planning to retire or very near retirement. From what I'm hearing, that seems to be the vast majority.\r\n\r\n## Further Shrinking the Workforce\r\n\r\nBeyond the Return to Office and the Deferred Resignation Program, there have been a few other attempts to downsize the federal workforce including eliminating DEI positions, firing probationary employees, and beginning preparations for a reduction in force (RIF).\r\n\r\n### Eliminating DEI\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the executive order \"[Ending Radical And Wasteful Government DEI Programs And Preferencing](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/ending-radical-and-wasteful-government-dei-programs-and-preferencing/)\", NASA eliminated all functions and people whose primary focus was DEI. I think only a couple of people fit this description at NASA, but there's been a further effort to remove all language related to DEI from all employee performance plans.\r\n\r\n#### Eliminating Gender\r\n\r\nIn addition to eliminating those positions and modifying performance plans, there were other changes mandated in a separate but related order titled \"[DEFENDING WOMEN FROM GENDER IDEOLOGY EXTREMISM AND RESTORING BIOLOGICAL TRUTH TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/defending-women-from-gender-ideology-extremism-and-restoring-biological-truth-to-the-federal-government/)\", such as replacing the word \"gender\" with \"sex\" in government forms and communications. I was tasked with making sure this change was made in one of our software applications that tracks mishaps. When someone is injured, we would collect their \"gender\" in the application, but had to change the name of that question to \"sex\".\r\n\r\nIt was a trivial change to make. But it was strange to see everybody so nervous about getting it done by the deadline, all the way up to my boss's boss's boss. Even seemingly minor orders create intense pressure, with tight deadlines, unclear consequences for noncompliance, and widespread fear of job loss.\r\n\r\n### Firing Probationary Employees\r\n\r\nWhen someone gets hired into the federal workforce, they start in a \"probationary\" period for the first year or two, depending on the position and agency. This is intended as a trial period, where the agency has more freedom to separate the employee within the probationary period if their performance does not meet the requirements of their position.\r\n\r\nWhat we're seeing now is an unprecedented use of the probationary period. Probationary employees are being [fired en masse at multiple federal agencies](https://www.forbes.com/sites/saradorn/2025/02/21/heres-where-trumps-government-layoffs-are-fema-irs-tsa-and-more/). This is almost certainly illegal, because the intent is that probationary employees can be separated without severance or appeal ***for performance reasons***. It will be interesting to see how this plays out in court, because many of those fired were given a generic reasoning of their termination being \"for performance reasons\" despite having stellar performance reviews and/or awards.\r\n\r\nLuckily, NASA has been spared from these probationary firings for now. It was a dramatic week though, with rumors that firings would happen Tuesday, then [rumors that it was paused by the White House](https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/02/nasa-receives-11th-hour-reprieve-from-probationary-employee-cuts/), then rumors that it would happen Friday, then nothing except [a statement from NASA that any probationary firings would be for performance reasons](https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/20/science/nasa-layoffs-workforce-firings/index.html#:~:text=NASA%20says%20job%20cuts%20for,Washington%2C%20DC%2C%20in%202023.).\r\n\r\n## Reduction in Force\r\n\r\nOne of the more recent executive orders is titled \"[Implementing The President‚Äôs ‚ÄúDepartment of Government Efficiency‚Äù Workforce Optimization](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/implementing-the-presidents-department-of-government-efficiency-workforce-optimization-initiative/)\". This executive order calls for a reduction in force across the federal government. Some of the language in the order has caused a lot of concern, such as:\r\n\r\n> Agency Heads shall promptly undertake preparations to initiate large-scale reductions in force (RIFs), consistent with applicable law, and ***to separate from Federal service temporary employees*** and reemployed annuitants working in areas that will likely be subject to the RIFs.\r\n\r\nI was hired in as a temporary employee, but luckily was converted to permanent last year. But I work with a few temporary employees who fear for their jobs based on the way this is worded. If this is carried out as-worded, it would impact a large chunk of NASA's workforce. Here's another concerning section:\r\n\r\n> All offices that perform functions not mandated by statute or other law shall be prioritized in the RIFs, including all agency diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives; all agency initiatives, components, or operations that my Administration suspends or closes; and ***all components and employees performing functions not mandated by statute or other law who are not typically designated as essential during a lapse in appropriations*** as provided in the Agency Contingency Plans on the Office of Management and Budget website.\r\n\r\nI don't understand how all employees not designated as essential during a lapse in appropriations should be prioritized in RIFs. At NASA, that's more than 90% of the workforce. When the government shuts down, it's pretty much just security and facility/IT maintenance who still come in to make sure things don't break or get stolen. I can't imagine this actually being implemented as it is worded, but the wording is causing a lot of confusion and frustration at NASA.\r\n\r\nSo far, the reduction hasn't actually begun, but agencies are planning for it. This will take time, but I have no idea what the breadth or scope of the reductions in force will be. I could lose my job from this, but there is no way to tell for sure right now. It helps that I was converted to a permanent position last year, but it doesn't help that I only have 3 years of federal service and do not have a veteran status.\r\n\r\n## The Latest Elon Email\r\n\r\nYesterday, Saturday, February 22, all federal employees received an email titled \"What did you do last week?\".\r\n\r\nThe email reads:\r\n\r\n> Please reply to this email with approx. 5 bullets of what you accomplished last week and cc your manager.\r\n> \r\n> Please do not send any classified information, links, or attachments.\r\n> \r\n> Deadline is this Monday at 11:59pmEST.\r\n\r\nViewed in isolation, that's weird, but not terrible. What makes it much more malicious is this tweet from Elon **before this email was sent:***\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Consistent with President <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">[@realDonaldTrump](https://micro.blog/realDonaldTrump)</a>‚Äôs instructions, all federal employees will shortly receive an email requesting to understand what they got done last week.<br><br>Failure to respond will be taken as a resignation.</p>&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1893386883444437415?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 22, 2025</a></blockquote> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\r\n\r\nI don't see any way it would be legal for a non-response to be equivalent to an employee submitting their resignation. It's hard to believe these are official government communications being sent to 2+ million federal workers.\r\n\r\nWhat's further frustrating is that OPM doesn't have the authority to ask for something like this.\r\n\r\nI plan not to respond unless I receive a direct order from NASA to respond.\r\n\r\nThe invisible subtext behind this email is offensive. It seems to say \"We don't believe you accomplished much of anything last week. Justify yourself to us, or resign.\" At the very least, this administration is clearly flexing its muscles and attempting to force federal workers to comply with its untraditional demands.\r\n\r\nWhile I hesitate to make such a strong analogy, I can't help but be reminded of the stories of German policemen in \"Ordinary Men\". They ended up committing atrocities they could never imagine, but were led to that place slowly by continually complying to small, seemingly innocuous orders. I can't help but wonder if these little orders are meant to condition me into a similar place of compliance and submission. The thought of that repulses me, but it is in the back of my mind with each new directive that comes out.\r\n\r\n## What's Next?\r\n\r\nNobody knows for certain what comes next, but it seems pretty clear that it won't be anything good, at least from the perspective of a federal employee. We know we have the reduction in force to look forward to. I'm certain we'll get some more Elon-inspired emails sent to the whole government. NASA has a DOGE rep installed at headquarters now, but I'm not sure exactly what they'll be doing. The word is that they're looking for contracts to cut. And the \"Fork in the Road\" email hinted that the performance ratings process will become more rigorous.\r\n\r\nOn March 14 government funding expires. I am not sure whether to expect a government shutdown or congress to pass a budget. If they do pass a budget, I suspect there will be new legislation included that will adversely affect federal employees. [Recent proposed legislation has suggested cuts to federal employee benefits](https://www.afge.org/article/124-billion-in-federal-benefits-on-house-republicans-chopping-block/).\r\n\r\nBeyond that, who knows. In the meantime, I will be getting my work done and doing my best to ignore all the noise this is causing. I hope to be a calming presence for my coworkers in the midst of all the chaos and fear. As a Christian, this is a good opportunity for me to \"love my neighbors\", especially as so much animosity is being directed at them. \r\n\r\nI also plan to keep this post updated at the bottom with any new things that happen, mostly as a reference for myself so I can look back someday and remember how wild things were as a fed back in 2025.\r\n\n## Updates\n\n- Feb 24, 2025: [Trump and Musk mock federal workers with memes.](https://weidok.al/2025/02/24/no-need-to-read-between.html)\r\n",

All possibilities.</p>\n<p>As far as my blog goes, 2025 will be similar to 2024. I want to write more, and I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll make design tweaks to my blog here and there. But otherwise I&rsquo;ll continue to write things that I think are meaningful and/or helpful.</p>\n<p>As far as my life goes, it looks like change is a brewin'. I&rsquo;m looking forward to the new year and all that it has to offer. Some things are scary, some are exciting, all will make for good writing material.</p>\n<p>I can&rsquo;t wait to share my perspective in the new year with you.

Direct traffic, LinkedIn, Google, Reddit, and my newsletter service were all big drivers.\n\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2025/b8563e19b7.png\" alt=\"\">\n\n\nMost people visiting my blog were probably using Chrome on a Windows machine.\n\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2025/dcf4b712b1.png\" alt=\"\">\n<img src=\"uploads/2025/ed24c7f037.png\" alt=\"\">\n\n\nSo, what is my takeaway from all of these analytics? Not much. It's fun to look at during the end of the year, but there's nothing actionable for me here. I'm not trying to supercharge my blog's growth. I just want to write meaningful and helpful words.\n\n\n## Design\n\n\nI made various changes to the look and feel of my blog throughout the year. You can see all the changes I made since June 10, 2024 in my [changelog](https://weidok.al/changelog/). It looks *very* different from where it originally started, which I shared screenshots of in [Tear it All Down](https://weidok.al/2024/02/24/tear-it-all.html).\n\n\nI'm following the KISS design principle: \"Keep It Simple Stupid\".\n\n\n## What will 2025 hold?\n\n\nYour guess is as good as mine. Will I become an author? Will I abandon my blog and run off with my pen and analog journal? Will artificial intelligence and quantum computing and brain chip implants converge to make the written word irrelevant as we all mind meld and communicate wordlessly and instantly? All possibilities.\n\n\nAs far as my blog goes, 2025 will be similar to 2024. I want to write more, and I'm sure I'll make design tweaks to my blog here and there. But otherwise I'll continue to write things that I think are meaningful and/or helpful.\n\n\nAs far as my life goes, it looks like change is a brewin'. I'm looking forward to the new year and all that it has to offer. Some things are scary, some are exciting, all will make for good writing material.\n\n\nI can't wait to share my perspective in the new year with you. Thanks for sticking around through my self-indulgent \"blog in review\" post.\n\n\nI wish you a happy new year and hope your year is filled with love, given and received.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

				"content_html": "<p>I learned it&rsquo;s weird to talk to your coworkers about your showering habits.</p>\n<p>The slightly uncomfortable laughs gave it away.</p>\n<p>But it&rsquo;s been on my mind because I&rsquo;ve been doing something different in the shower lately. I think showers are more than just a way to get clean. They&rsquo;re also a space to think. While most people have &ldquo;shower thoughts&rdquo;, I bet a majority can&rsquo;t remember them.</p>\n<p>When I say that showers are a &ldquo;space to think&rdquo;, I don&rsquo;t just mean they&rsquo;re a place to have thoughts pop in and out. I mean they are a place to do real thinking. To me, real thinking involves:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Loading up your <strong>short-term memory</strong> to work through a web of thought.</li>\n<li>Moving the important bits over to <strong>long-term memory</strong> for future use.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Unfortunately, my brain is terrible at real thinking. It may be an inborn trait, or it may be a symptom of growing up a digital native. My brain feels like it&rsquo;s wired for <em>reacting</em>: social media, texting, news cycles, etc. But I struggle to just&hellip; think.</p>\n<p>Except I have a little trick to help me do real thinking: <em>writing things down</em>. The paper is part memory-aid and part memory-replacement. Seeing the words in writing helps encode them in my brain, but it also provides a hard-copy of the thought in case my brain fails to hold onto it. Yet even more helpful is using the paper as my short-term memory. I can follow a long chain of thought and remember every step I took. When my thoughts are trapped in paper, they are outside of me, so it is easier to separate my thoughts from my self. I can observe them with more objectivity.</p>\n<p>So showers are a space for thinking, but real thinking requires writing. Therefore, showers are a space for writing.</p>\n<p>But <em>how</em> does one write in the shower?</p>\n<p>I use <a href=\"https://www.myaquanotes.com/\">Aqua Notes</a>.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p><em>This is not a paid post and there are no affiliate links.

The shower seems to have a unique capacity for shining a light on the recesses of my mind. Then the paper can capture the fleeting ideas that usually lie dormant in these recesses.</p>\n<p>I have used Aqua notes to capture all sorts of shower thoughts, from random ideas, to poetry, to visuals. I want to tell you more about what Aqua Notes is, how I&rsquo;ve used it, and other things I tried before Aqua Notes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-aqua-notes\">What is Aqua Notes?</h2>\n<p>Aqua Notes is a simple product.

It is surprisingly easy to write on with pencil, even when wet!</p>\n<p>I have not seen this advertised or discussed anywhere, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that each piece of paper can be ripped off and stuck to the wall by itself. It just takes a little water, and I&rsquo;ve never had a piece of paper fall off the wall from drying out. This lets me write on the reverse side of each paper and fill up my shower wall with notes like a mad scientist.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Being able to rip off pieces of paper also means that I can take my notes with me outside the shower if I need to.</p>\n<p>The paper is a little difficult to rip cleanly (although it is perforated) so you have to be careful when pulling a page off the pad.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-pencil\">The Pencil</h3>\n<p>The pencil is a standard graphite pencil that needs to be sharpened occasionally.

I also write down my own notes about impactful ideas I want to remember.</p>\n<h3 id=\"visuals\">Visuals</h3>\n<p>Many thoughts are better captured in a visual rather than words.

After being inspired by his journey, I took a look at <a href=\"%5Bhttps://levels.io/blog/%5D(https://levels.io/blog/)\">his blog</a> and a couple of his posts gave me more to look into:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://levels.io/startups/\">https://levels.io/startups/</a> - how to take an idea from 0 to 100</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://levels.io/copywriting/\">https://levels.io/copywriting/</a> - dead simple advice for writing good copy</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://levels.io/hoodmaps/\">https://levels.io/hoodmaps/</a> - a crazy long post documenting how Pieter built an app from the first line of code to being complete</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Looking at these posts then led me to <a href=\"%5Bhttps://news.ycombinator.com/show%5D(https://news.ycombinator.com/show)\">Show Hacker News</a>, <a href=\"%5Bhttps://www.indiehackers.com/starting-up%5D(https://www.indiehackers.com/starting-up)\">Indie Hackers</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.producthunt.com/\">Product Hunt</a>. <a href=\"%5Bhttps://news.ycombinator.com/show%5D(https://news.ycombinator.com/show)\">Show Hacker News</a> is a great place to see what other people are building and to see how the &ldquo;hacker community&rdquo; responds. <a href=\"%5Bhttps://www.indiehackers.com/starting-up%5D(https://www.indiehackers.com/starting-up)\">Indie Hackers</a> has all sorts of articles and resources with info on getting started. They also have a podcast I just stumbled on today! I had never heard of <a href=\"https://www.producthunt.com/\">Product Hunt</a> before, but it&rsquo;s a place where each day new apps get launched and then voted on. The most popular apps rise to the top, so for the early-adopter community it is a way to see what hot new apps are available, and for makers it is a great way to get visibility and users for a new product.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-indie-hacking-means-to-me\">What Indie Hacking Means To Me</h2>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve been inspired by all the stories I&rsquo;ve read and the products I&rsquo;ve seen. My day job is fun and rewarding, but it has become removed from coding. I miss the tight feedback loop of having a small feature in my head to build and then bringing it to life. To reconcile that, I&rsquo;m moonlighting as an indie hacker. I have no grand monetization scheme, no clearly laid out plan, and little free time as a new dad working a full-time job. But I&rsquo;m building nonetheless. My latest creation is <a href=\"http://fedmeetup.com/\">fedmeetup.com</a>, and I just pushed some new updates to it over the last week.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m still a bit embarrassed by how wonky the interface looks (need to work on my design skills) but I&rsquo;m trying to embrace the indie hacker mantra of &ldquo;ship early, ship often&rdquo;. Fed Meetup solves a problem (Where should I host a federal in-person event to maximize savings of taxpayer dollars?) in its current form, so I&rsquo;ve released it into the wild and will build it alongside those using it. I know of at least a couple of people at NASA who have started using it and I plan to broadcast it more widely through NASA. Once it has had success at NASA, I&rsquo;ll start outreach to other agencies.</p>\n<p>On top of Fed Meetup, I have other ideas that I&rsquo;m itching to build:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I want to make an app for prayer that combines the best elements of Duolingo and Readwise. I often tell people I will pray for them and then forget, so I want to build something that solves that. A place I can store the things I want to be praying for, that also reminds me to pray and maybe even has some gamification to encourage me to keep engaging with my prayers.</li>\n<li>I also want to make a quick capture app. What I really want to make is a widget for an android or iPhone, that makes it dead simple to capture quick notes and have a running log of these quick notes. I haven&rsquo;t found a satisfying solution for this yet.</li>\n<li>I&rsquo;ve also considered writing a weekly email newsletter that either has a paid subscription option or a donate option. It would have to be something that provides value&hellip; I was thinking either &ldquo;hacks&rdquo; for the average office user to use their computer better, or a weekly interview with someone who works at NASA, highlighting the person and their work.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This is just the beginning of my ideas, so I&rsquo;m going to create an /ideas page on this blog to store all of them. I want to share these publicly partly for accountability and partly because I think they need to be built, so I welcome others to build them too! If you have any interesting ideas you think we could work on together, I would love to hear them.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-piece-im-missing\">The Piece I&rsquo;m Missing</h2>\n<p>The main way I differ from other indie hackers is that I don&rsquo;t have an intense focus on monetization. I&rsquo;m more of an indie hobbyist, who may one day metamorphose from hobbyist to hacker. Indie hackers are usually very focused on their Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) which is the key measure for a subscription based business. After reviewing my financial situation, my MRR between my blog and Fed Meetup is -$7. I pay $5/mo for blog hosting, and about $1/mo each for my domain names. And none of this is pulling in any money.</p>\n<p>For now, I am content with that. I&rsquo;m enjoying the craft of both writing and building software products. It brings me immense joy to write these blog posts and to build things like Fed Meetup. However, I do dream of a day when the side projects I&rsquo;ve built over time could support my family financially. I am quite happy supporting my family through my W-2 job, but I am attracted to the romanticized freedom that having my own business(es) would afford. I know it won&rsquo;t be all sunshine and rainbows, but I think it would fit my personality well.</p>\n<p>In my mind, the key to all of this is experimentation. This is not a big announcement of a shift in focus or career for me. Rather, this is me sharing a potential future path that I plan to experiment with. I plan to start small with my hobbyist projects, giving some more thought to how I can monetize them. Actually, I&rsquo;m quite excited about experimenting with monetization and value. Stories like the <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/lessonsfromthepast-how-swinmurns-wizard-oz-birthed-obasi-aca--hp69e/\">Zappos founder</a>, Nick Swinmurn, fuel my imagination. He set up an online shoe store before having any inventory. While he was validating the company&rsquo;s value proposition (would people buy shoes online without trying them on?), he would receive orders and then go out himself to local shoe stores to buy shoes and ship them out. Finding opportunities for this kind of &ldquo;Wizard of Oz&rdquo; testing to validate business viability is exciting and fun to me.</p>\n<p>So why am I sharing all of this? Because you can expect to hear more from me about what I&rsquo;m building. <a href=\"https://whop.com/blog/building-in-public-guide/\">Building in public</a> is about authentically sharing the journey from idea to product. I hope to do just that and I invite you to join me and follow along.</p>\n",

I also want to make a quick capture app. What I really want to make is a widget for an android or iPhone, that makes it dead simple to capture quick notes and have a running log of these quick notes. I haven't found a satisfying solution for this yet.\n3. I've also considered writing a weekly email newsletter that either has a paid subscription option or a donate option. It would have to be something that provides value... I was thinking either \"hacks\" for the average office user to use their computer better, or a weekly interview with someone who works at NASA, highlighting the person and their work.\n\n\nThis is just the beginning of my ideas, so I'm going to create an /ideas page on this blog to store all of them. I want to share these publicly partly for accountability and partly because I think they need to be built, so I welcome others to build them too! If you have any interesting ideas you think we could work on together, I would love to hear them.\n\n\n## The Piece I'm Missing\n\n\nThe main way I differ from other indie hackers is that I don't have an intense focus on monetization. I'm more of an indie hobbyist, who may one day metamorphose from hobbyist to hacker. Indie hackers are usually very focused on their Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) which is the key measure for a subscription based business. After reviewing my financial situation, my MRR between my blog and Fed Meetup is -$7. I pay $5/mo for blog hosting, and about $1/mo each for my domain names. And none of this is pulling in any money.\n\n\nFor now, I am content with that. I'm enjoying the craft of both writing and building software products. It brings me immense joy to write these blog posts and to build things like Fed Meetup. However, I do dream of a day when the side projects I've built over time could support my family financially. I am quite happy supporting my family through my W-2 job, but I am attracted to the romanticized freedom that having my own business(es) would afford. I know it won't be all sunshine and rainbows, but I think it would fit my personality well.\n\n\nIn my mind, the key to all of this is experimentation. This is not a big announcement of a shift in focus or career for me. Rather, this is me sharing a potential future path that I plan to experiment with. I plan to start small with my hobbyist projects, giving some more thought to how I can monetize them. Actually, I'm quite excited about experimenting with monetization and value. Stories like the [Zappos founder](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/lessonsfromthepast-how-swinmurns-wizard-oz-birthed-obasi-aca--hp69e/), Nick Swinmurn, fuel my imagination. He set up an online shoe store before having any inventory. While he was validating the company's value proposition (would people buy shoes online without trying them on?), he would receive orders and then go out himself to local shoe stores to buy shoes and ship them out. Finding opportunities for this kind of \"Wizard of Oz\" testing to validate business viability is exciting and fun to me.\n\n\nSo why am I sharing all of this? Because you can expect to hear more from me about what I'm building. [Building in public](https://whop.com/blog/building-in-public-guide/) is about authentically sharing the journey from idea to product. I hope to do just that and I invite you to join me and follow along.\n",

				"content_html": "<p>I recently turned 26. I&rsquo;m no sage, but I&rsquo;ve picked up a couple of lessons in my time. Below are 26 things I would tell a younger me if I could.</p>\n<p><strong>1</strong> Read more material that endures. Posts and videos are ephemeral. They come and go. Seek out knowledge and stories that have survived years, decades, or centuries.</p>\n<p><strong>2</strong> Write as much as you can. Write anything. Document your days. You&rsquo;ll love flipping through old journal entries, and seeing what you were doing. Trap your anxious and messy thoughts on paper, so they don&rsquo;t consume your mind. When confronted with something hard, think through it in writing. It will slow you down, and allow you to evaluate your thoughts more clearly.</p>\n<p><strong>3</strong> You have an aversion to conflict. You can feel it in your bones. That&rsquo;s okay. Stay in it, and realize there are many ways to work through conflict. Guide the conflict into a style that you do well with. Conflict can be important, so do not avoid it when it is necessary. Stay calm and explain yourself clearly, even if you need to tremble through it.</p>\n<p><strong>4</strong> You have a guilty conscience. This is good because it means you have a sense of morality but beware of people who will try to use that against you. If someone or something is making you feel guilty, pay close attention to the motives.</p>\n<p><strong>5</strong> Smile, make eye contact, and when you ask someone how they are, really ask them.</p>\n<p><strong>6</strong> The world is lonely without a community that shares your values. As soon as you realize you do not have this, find it. Or make it.</p>\n<p><strong>7</strong> You can become a good public speaker. Like conflict, you feel like you need to run from it, but the truth is you must do exactly the opposite. Seek out opportunities to speak in front of others. It will be uncomfortable, but the more you do it, the better you will get. And absolutely practice beforehand, winging it is a terrible idea.</p>\n<p><strong>8</strong> Stay open. Much of the good in your life will come from opportunities you didn&rsquo;t foresee at all and had no control over. You might miss them if you keep too tight a grip on what you think you need.</p>\n<p><strong>9</strong> Related to the above, don&rsquo;t forget how much you owe to God and luck. You think you know this, but you cannot comprehend its depth.</p>\n<p><strong>10</strong> Remember that every lie you tell will be accompanied by a confession, or worse, an exposure. Think of this anytime you consider lying, and do not do it. Lying is like smoking, it builds up tar in your soul.</p>\n<p><strong>11</strong> Remember that it&rsquo;s temporary. In the midst of anxiety, it will feel all-consuming and never-ending. It isn&rsquo;t so. It will end.</p>\n<p><strong>12</strong> Everybody is fascinating if you ask. So ask, then listen.</p>\n<p><strong>13</strong> Initiate connection in your marriage daily. It will not initiate itself.</p>\n<p><strong>14</strong> Step up and lead. Getting everyone&rsquo;s opinion and deciding by majority may feel inclusive, but it is not leading. You will need to make tough, uncomfortable, and even unpopular calls. Make them and then bear them.</p>\n<p><strong>15</strong> You so desire to be better that you will have a tendency to believe all feedback you receive. Some feedback is neither valid nor helpful. Don&rsquo;t get stirred up over it. Recognize it for what it is, and move on.</p>\n<p><strong>16</strong> Say what you want. Especially to your managers at work. People don&rsquo;t know what you want if you don&rsquo;t tell them. Most people will try to help you get what you want if they know what it is.</p>\n<p><strong>17</strong> Never disbelieve in what you are capable of. You will learn to love olives. And you will become a master diaper changer. If you can do those, you can do anything.</p>\n<p><strong>18</strong> Nourish your curiosity. You do a good job of exploring new things and not caring so much if others think they&rsquo;re weird. In fact, relish in the confused gaze you get when you tell people about your new abstract hobby or interest. Keep doing that.</p>\n<p><strong>19</strong> You follow rules really well. Try breaking them more.</p>\n<p><strong>20</strong> Just because everyone is doing it, does not mean it&rsquo;s good for you. You are allowed to completely cut yourself off from things that are not good for you.</p>\n<p><strong>21</strong> Don&rsquo;t get too obsessed with being better or doing better. You&rsquo;ll lose sight of now, which is bad because it&rsquo;s always now. Be present. Accept what is.</p>\n<p><strong>22</strong> Start developing habits to maintain your health. Your high metabolism will not last forever, and avoiding the doctor will only cause more problems later. Get a primary care physician, see a dermatologist, and keep up with the dentist.</p>\n<p><strong>23</strong> Don&rsquo;t be ashamed of your age. People use age as a proxy for competence and trustworthiness, so these assumptions will not be given to you easily. Be honest about who you are, and what you are, and lean into your strengths. Wherever you are, you are there for a reason, even if you feel out of place.</p>\n<p><strong>24</strong> Please take yourself less seriously. Not everything needs to be about &ldquo;finding signal&rdquo; or doing better. Have fun and be goofy.

With markdown formatting, Obsidian is so much easier to to format on-the-fly than other note-taking apps I&rsquo;ve tried in the past.

Not been doing great here. With all my creative passion recently, I&rsquo;ve thrown exercise to the side. I&rsquo;m looking to change that though. The doc says I have elevated cholesterol and triglycerides, so it&rsquo;s time to take exercise seriously and back off the carbs. I&rsquo;m sad about taking time away from all the things above that I love, but there&rsquo;s plenty of &ldquo;gray&rdquo; time in my day where I&rsquo;m just distracted that I could take from instead. And I know from the past that getting into a good exercise routine will just bring me more energy and vigor, so it will be additive rather than subtractive. My wife and I tried some YouTube yoga together yesterday, but then as we were about to enter child&rsquo;s pose she noticed a small spider in front of her face and that abruptly ended our session!</p>",

I'm going to re-edge it and put in some landscaping rock instead of mulch because I do not want to deal with mulch every year. \n\n### Leisure\n\nIn between everything above, I'm trying to make time for [disc golf with friends](https://weidok.al/2024/04/28/beautiful-day-out.html) every now and then so they don't pass me up :) I've also been enjoying reading [\"Foundation and Empire\" by Isaac Asimov](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29581.Foundation_and_Empire?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=Ko73QCm0g0&rank=1). \n\n### Exercise\n\nYeah.... Not been doing great here. With all my creative passion recently, I've thrown exercise to the side. I'm looking to change that though. The doc says I have elevated cholesterol and triglycerides, so it's time to take exercise seriously and back off the carbs. I'm sad about taking time away from all the things above that I love, but there's plenty of \"gray\" time in my day where I'm just distracted that I could take from instead. And I know from the past that getting into a good exercise routine will just bring me more energy and vigor, so it will be additive rather than subtractive. My wife and I tried some YouTube yoga together yesterday, but then as we were about to enter child's pose she noticed a small spider in front of her face and that abruptly ended our session!\n",

I don&rsquo;t receive a <em>ton</em> of text messages, but with no system at all to handle them, I felt overwhelmed when opening my messaging app and was ghosting a lot of people as a result.</p>\n<p>This led to some cognitive dissonance where I felt like a wizard in the world of email, but I felt like a Neanderthal when it came to responding to friends and family over text.</p>\n<h2 id=\"my-text-message-triage-system\">My Text Message Triage System</h2>\n<p>Now my process for handling texts is similar to my process for emails.

Can This Conversation Be Deleted?</h3>\n<p>Bye-bye spam. I don&rsquo;t delete many conversations because they don&rsquo;t take up much storage anyway, but if it&rsquo;s something I know I will never revisit then I burn it with fire and move on with my day.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2-is-this-message-just-for-reference\">2. Is This Message Just for Reference?</h3>\n<p>Archive it! If I don&rsquo;t need to respond, then conversations go straight to my archive where they can still be searched and retrieved.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3-can-i-respond-in-2-minutes\">3. Can I Respond In 2 Minutes?</h3>\n<p>Just do it! Future-me has better things to do and doesn&rsquo;t need the cognitive overhead of thinking about needing to respond. Knock this out now.</p>\n<p>After I&rsquo;ve responded, I archive the conversation to get it out of my inbox.

				"content_text": "**Me**: \"Oh, I need to respond to that later.\"\n\n**Text Message**: *cries softly as it floats into the void, never to be seen again*\n\n<!--more-->\n\n## Text Message Chaos and Overwhelm\n\nUntil recently, I've managed my text messages differently from email or work-related instant messaging.\n\nI never did anything with text messages other than collect hundreds upon hundreds of conversations that sat in a chronological heap waiting to welcome me each time I opened my messaging app.  Conversations that needed a response would get intermixed with ones that did not need a response and would get buried as more messages were received in yet other conversations. I don't receive a *ton* of text messages, but with no system at all to handle them, I felt overwhelmed when opening my messaging app and was ghosting a lot of people as a result.\n\nThis led to some cognitive dissonance where I felt like a wizard in the world of email, but I felt like a Neanderthal when it came to responding to friends and family over text.\n\n## My Text Message Triage System\n\nNow my process for handling texts is similar to my process for emails. Conceptually, I think of my messaging app like my email inbox, with each conversation being like an extremely long-running email thread.\n\nFor each message I receive, I work through the following questions:\n\n### 1. Can This Conversation Be Deleted?\n\nBye-bye spam. I don't delete many conversations because they don't take up much storage anyway, but if it's something I know I will never revisit then I burn it with fire and move on with my day.\n\n### 2. Is This Message Just for Reference?\n\nArchive it! If I don't need to respond, then conversations go straight to my archive where they can still be searched and retrieved.\n\n### 3. Can I Respond In 2 Minutes?\n\nJust do it! Future-me has better things to do and doesn't need the cognitive overhead of thinking about needing to respond. Knock this out now.\n\nAfter I've responded, I archive the conversation to get it out of my inbox. The only exception is if I am awaiting a quick response and I will want to follow up if I don't receive one. Then it stays in the inbox.\n\n### 4. Do I Need to Respond, But Can't Right Now?\n\nThis one is a more context dependent.\n\nIf I can't respond because *I just don't have time*, then the message stays in the inbox. Unread or read, doesn't matter. If it's in the inbox, I need to get to it. \n\nIf *I need to do something before I can respond*, then that gets transferred to my to-do list, and I leave the message in the inbox.\n\n## Other Notes on My System\n\n### Some Group Chats Stay in The Inbox\n\nI would love to get to complete inbox-zero and archive EVERYTHING, but with Google Messages if I archive a group chat, it is clunky to start a new message to the chat. So, I leave three of my high-volume group chats in my inbox at all times. \n\n### Use Swipe Actions\n\nSwipe right to delete a conversation, swipe left to archive it. This helps me move through messages quickly.\n",

The owner can add Admins, but Admins cannot add other Admins.\n> \n> After clicking the button, the user selects a person and a role, and then can save them as a member to the case. After saving, the new member should be displayed in the case members table.\n> \n> The role options will be...\n> \n> - Case Roles\n>     - **Admin**¬†(CRUD, only visible to case owner)\n>     - **Contributor**¬†(CRU, D data they created. Can remove items from diagram)\n>     - **Report Editor**¬†(R, U report section)\n>     - **View Only**¬†(R)\n> \n> Note that \"Owner\" is not one of the role options, because the owner is whoever created the case and there will only ever be one owner per case.\n> \n> # Acceptance Criteria\n> \n> **GIVEN**¬†I am a <role>(owner, case admin)  \n> **WHEN**¬†I add a member as a contributor  \n> **THEN**¬†the member is displayed in the case members table with the contributor role\n> \n> **GIVEN**¬†I am a <role>(contributor, report editor, view only)  \n> **THEN**¬†I do not see the button to add a member\n> \n> **GIVEN**¬†I am \"case admin\"  \n> **WHEN**¬†I am selecting the role for a new member  \n> **THEN**¬†I can not select \"case admin\"\n\nWhile this template helps define the user story, it is important to remember that the user story is a placeholder for conversation. If you write this up and then immediately push it to your team to work on it, you're missing the beauty of the user story. Bring your draft of the user story before the team and then have a conversation about it. Invite ideas and questions from others on the team. Define and come to a common understanding of the problem to be solved, or the value to be delivered. Then determine how you will bring forth that solution or value.\n\nIf you adopt this template or some variation of it, reach out to let me know!\n",

				"title": "Tear It All Down",
				"content_html": "<p><a href=\"https://weidok.al\">My website</a> looked quite different at its beginning. I thought starting a blog would be a good opportunity to play around with new technology, so I decided to teach myself <a href=\"https://kit.svelte.dev/\">SvelteKit</a> and build my site with it. It was very exciting: I would build in SvelteKit, write all my posts as standalone markdown files, and deploy on <a href=\"https://vercel.com/\">Vercel</a>. As I started building and exploring what other people had done to get inspiration, I came across a concept called the <a href=\"https://indieweb.org/\">IndieWeb</a>. I felt aligned with the values of this web community, so I wanted to build my site to be part of it. Suddenly, my to-do list was expanding rapidly to include all sorts of IndieWeb specs and principles. Would markdown files be enough to do everything I wanted to do? Perhaps I would need to set up a database using something like <a href=\"https://supabase.com/\">Supabase</a>&hellip;</p>\n<p>The more I added to my to-do list for the site, the more I began to dread working on it. This was supposed to be fun, what happened?</p>\n<p>I lost my Why. What I <em>really</em> wanted was to start writing. To have a place to share myself and to figure out how to do that. That was my Why. But I wasn&rsquo;t clear on that. I thought this site would be a good place to write <em>and</em> be a fun coding project. Mixing those was a mistake for me. I became so consumed with perfecting the design and functionality that I had no time to think about writing.</p>\n<p>So what to do? I had this thing that I built, that I actually quite liked, but it was taking me further from my Why rather than toward it.</p>\n<p>I decided to tear it all down.</p>\n<p>I threw everything away and started from a blank slate. How could I just write? How could I stay connected to my Why? A blogging platform, duh! Other people have already solved the problem of creating a website whose primary purpose is publishing writing. In fact, <a href=\"https://www.manton.org/\">Manton</a> over at <a href=\"https://micro.blog/\">Micro.blog</a> solved that problem <em>and</em> built his solution on the IndieWeb principles I admire, so that was the clear choice for me. I took everything I had written and migrated it over to Micro.blog, abandoning my SvelteKit project.</p>\n<p>After the migration, everything felt better. I had space to write, space to bring forth my Why. I still couldn&rsquo;t keep myself from customizing themes and plugins to make the site my own, but a little bit of play is okay as long as it leaves my Why undisturbed.</p>\n<p>Why had this not been obvious in the beginning? Well for one, I didn&rsquo;t even know about Micro.blog or the IndieWeb when I started out.

				"content_text": "[My website](https://weidok.al) looked quite different at its beginning. I thought starting a blog would be a good opportunity to play around with new technology, so I decided to teach myself [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) and build my site with it. It was very exciting: I would build in SvelteKit, write all my posts as standalone markdown files, and deploy on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). As I started building and exploring what other people had done to get inspiration, I came across a concept called the [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/). I felt aligned with the values of this web community, so I wanted to build my site to be part of it. Suddenly, my to-do list was expanding rapidly to include all sorts of IndieWeb specs and principles. Would markdown files be enough to do everything I wanted to do? Perhaps I would need to set up a database using something like [Supabase](https://supabase.com/)...\n\nThe more I added to my to-do list for the site, the more I began to dread working on it. This was supposed to be fun, what happened?\n\nI lost my Why. What I *really* wanted was to start writing. To have a place to share myself and to figure out how to do that. That was my Why. But I wasn't clear on that. I thought this site would be a good place to write *and* be a fun coding project. Mixing those was a mistake for me. I became so consumed with perfecting the design and functionality that I had no time to think about writing.\n\nSo what to do? I had this thing that I built, that I actually quite liked, but it was taking me further from my Why rather than toward it.\n\nI decided to tear it all down.\n\nI threw everything away and started from a blank slate. How could I just write? How could I stay connected to my Why? A blogging platform, duh! Other people have already solved the problem of creating a website whose primary purpose is publishing writing. In fact, [Manton](https://www.manton.org/) over at [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog/) solved that problem *and* built his solution on the IndieWeb principles I admire, so that was the clear choice for me. I took everything I had written and migrated it over to Micro.blog, abandoning my SvelteKit project.\n\nAfter the migration, everything felt better. I had space to write, space to bring forth my Why. I still couldn't keep myself from customizing themes and plugins to make the site my own, but a little bit of play is okay as long as it leaves my Why undisturbed.\n\nWhy had this not been obvious in the beginning? Well for one, I didn't even know about Micro.blog or the IndieWeb when I started out. But more importantly, my thinking had been clouded by an unclear Why and a fear of judgment, which I've come to realize are connected. My fear was something like, \"This is supposed to be a web software guy and he didn't build his own site from scratch? He must not **really** know his stuff.\"\n\nThat's a silly fear. Who cares? Have you seen all the intelligent people working in the web space that host their sites on a platform? They're everywhere! And yet, I could not come to that realization until I was really clear on my Why.\n\nI share all of this to implore you to evaluate your Why. Do you have the right Why? Are you clear on it? Is what you're doing moving you in the right direction? If not, it's very possible that you can make minor course corrections to get you back on track. You should try that first. But if you've gotten far away from your Why, don't be afraid to tear it all down. It's okay to start at zero. The sunk cost has already sunk, so don't drown yourself trying to save it.\n\nTearing it all down is not the fastest way to do a thing, but it may be the way to do *the right* thing. \n\n---\n\nHere are some screenshots of what the site looked like before.

				"content_html": "<p>I use my <a href=\"https://obsidian.md/\">Obsidian</a> daily note as my main digital jumping-off point for things like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>habits</li>\n<li>daily log</li>\n<li>tasks</li>\n<li>journaling</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve gathered ideas for setting this up from all over the internet over many months, and unfortunately, I don&rsquo;t recall all the resources I used. <a href=\"https://dannb.org/blog/2022/obsidian-daily-note-template/\">Dann Berg&rsquo;s post</a> inspired my &ldquo;Today&rsquo;s Notes&rdquo; section, and I first learned a lot about Obsidian from <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@linkingyourthinking\">Nick Milo&rsquo;s YouTube channel</a>.</p>\n<p>Below I outline what my template looks like, and how I set it up.</p>\n<h1 id=\"table-of-contents\">Table of Contents</h1>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#overview\">Overview</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#plugins\">Plugins</a>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#daily-notes-and-periodic-notes\">Daily Notes and Periodic Notes</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#templater\">Templater</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#dataview\">Dataview</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#tasks\">Tasks</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#quickadd\">QuickAdd</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#buttons\">Buttons</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#calendar\">Calendar</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"#the-template\">The Template</a>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#frontmatter-habits\">Frontmatter Habits</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#daily-quote\">Daily Quote</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#title\">Title</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#navigation\">Navigation</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#daily-log\">Daily Log</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#tasks-1\">Tasks</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#5-minute-journal\">5 Minute Journal</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#todays-notes\">Today&rsquo;s Notes</a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"#final-thoughts\">Final Thoughts</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"overview\">Overview</h1>\n<p>My template allows me to have the same daily note created for me each day. Here&rsquo;s what it looks like:</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>I&rsquo;ll talk more about each individual section later in this post, but overall this daily note has helped me to become more organized and focused. Its primary purpose is managing tasks and rapidly logging notes throughout the day. Having one place to collect both tasks and quick notes has been helpful for me. A nice perk of doing it in Obsidian is that those quick notes can easily evolve into standalone markdown files if they need to, but the key is having a really <em>low friction</em> place to capture a thought or task.</p>\n<p>Having my daily note link to other &ldquo;periodic&rdquo; notes (daily, weekly, monthly) feels very Obsidian-ish, but truth be told I don&rsquo;t use the links too often. They are nice when I need them though, like quickly needing to get to something I logged yesterday.</p>\n<p>I used to use the 5 Minute Journal section more than I do now, but this has been replaced by analog journaling. I sort of miss having this stored digitally, and I&rsquo;m sure I could hack together some awesome digital journal dashboard with Dataview, but that&rsquo;s not really the point, is it? Journaling analog helps me to slow down and really reflect, which seems to make my individual sessions more meaningful. And that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m really looking for. All that being said, I do still like using the 5-Minute Journal occasionally when I&rsquo;m feeling scattered and need a quick dose of mindfulness while at my computer.</p>\n<p>The Today&rsquo;s Notes section is another one I don&rsquo;t use too often, but it&rsquo;s fun to have. I&rsquo;m not using it to navigate between notes I&rsquo;m currently working on that day, because Obsidian has great navigation features I&rsquo;m using instead (e.g., tabs, search). But I do like having it whenever I take a look at past daily notes. It&rsquo;s fun to see a snapshot of what I worked on any given day, and the combination of the daily log, completed tasks, and Today&rsquo;s Notes paints a nice picture of what I was doing and thinking.</p>\n<h1 id=\"plugins\">Plugins</h1>\n<h2 id=\"daily-notes-and-periodic-notes\">Daily Notes and Periodic Notes</h2>\n<p>These plugins both can create a daily note from a specified template file. Periodic Notes allows the creation of some additional types of notes, like weekly, monthly, quarterly, and yearly.</p>\n<p>I prefer to keep my daily notes in their own folder, and each daily note&rsquo;s title is formatted as <code>YYYY-MM-DD</code>.</p>\n<p>I keep my template file in &ldquo;Bins/Templates/Daily Note&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>Here&rsquo;s my config for Daily Notes:</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Here&rsquo;s my config for Periodic Notes (you&rsquo;ll see I also use weekly and monthly notes, which I link to from my daily note):</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<h2 id=\"templater\">Templater</h2>\n<p>With Templater, if I create a file from a template, either manually or through Daily Notes or Periodic Notes, I can run some code from my template <em>when the template is instantiated</em>. This allows me to get things like the current date, daily quote, date ranges for tasks, and file title at the time when I use the template.</p>\n<p>You can even use Templater to run your own JavaScript during note creation, but I am not using that in the current iteration of my daily notes template.</p>\n<p>Here is my current config for Templater:</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>The two important parts are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Specify a template folder (I use &ldquo;Bins/Templates&rdquo;)</li>\n<li>Trigger Templater on new file creation. You want this on so that Templater works with Daily Notes and Periodic Notes.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I use Templater all over my daily note template, and anything between <code>&lt;% ... %&gt;</code> is Templater syntax.</p>\n<h2 id=\"dataview\">Dataview</h2>\n<p>Dataview is a powerful way to query data across all of your notes in your Obsidian vault. For my daily note, I use it to display any notes I created or modified that day.</p>\n<p>I don&rsquo;t believe I did anything unique with the config for Dataview, much of the setup is for viewing preference.</p>\n<h2 id=\"tasks\">Tasks</h2>\n<p>Obsidian is the main place I track tasks digitally, and I use the Tasks plugin to do that. My full setup with Tasks warrants a separate post, but for my daily note I use it to capture tasks in my Daily Log and to display tasks that are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>overdue</li>\n<li>due today</li>\n<li>coming soon (next 3 days)</li>\n<li>completed today</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I haven&rsquo;t changed much from the default Tasks config. I just have it configured to add a &ldquo;done date&rdquo; each time I complete a task.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<h2 id=\"quickadd\">QuickAdd</h2>\n<p>QuickAdd allows running macros from anywhere in Obsidian. I have a macro setup that can be run from anywhere and allows me to quickly write up text that gets appended at the top of my Daily Log with the current timestamp.</p>\n<p>To configure this I created a macro called &ldquo;Capture to daily note&rdquo; in QuickAdd:</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>In the settings for that macro, I tell it where to add the text, and how to create the Daily Note if it has not already been created:</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>To summarize, QuickAdd looks for today&rsquo;s daily note, and then inserts my supplied text after the header I supplied, which is <code>## Daily Log</code>, and gives it some special formatting that I specify near the bottom of the settings. More on this in the Daily Log Section.</p>\n<h2 id=\"buttons\">Buttons</h2>\n<p>Buttons allows you to place buttons in your notes that can run macros. I use a button in my daily note templated to run the QuickAdd macro I described above. This allows me to really quickly capture a short note to my daily log, even if I am viewing my Daily Note on reading mode (which is something I end up doing often from mobile).</p>\n<h2 id=\"calendar\">Calendar</h2>\n<p>I use the calendar plugin to navigate between my daily and weekly notes, and to create them.</p>\n<h1 id=\"the-template\">The Template</h1>\n<p>You can get the full template from this <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/jakeweidokal/027072dc75ddc77ec9595739808db592\">Gist on Github</a>. Below I&rsquo;ll break down the template by section so you can take only the pieces and parts you need.</p>\n<h2 id=\"frontmatter-habits\">Frontmatter Habits</h2>\n<h3 id=\"template\">Template</h3>\n<pre tabindex=\"0\"><code>---\nweek: &lt;% tp.date.now('ww',0, tp.file.title, 'YYYY-MM-DD') %&gt;\nweight:\nstartEating:\nendEating:\ntags: daily\n---\n</code></pre><h3 id=\"plugins-used\">Plugins Used</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Templater</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"description\">Description</h3>\n<p>For my habits section, I use the YAML frontmatter of the markdown file to track any daily habits. I use Templater to get the week number and save it as a property. I also use the Frontmatter to tag all daily notes with the <code>#daily</code> tag.  After that, all additional front matter fields are used to track daily metrics, which could be things like weight, times, mood, etc.</p>\n<p>To be honest, I don&rsquo;t use this much anymore, but it was useful when I was doing intermittent fasting. I was eating within an 8 hour window each day, so I used this section to track when I started eating, when I stopped eating, and my weight. Then, with this data stored in each daily note, I used the Obsidian Charts plugin in my weekly and monthly notes to trend my progress over time. If you are interested in how this is setup, shoot me an email and let me know.</p>\n<p>Example of Obsidian Charts in one of my monthly notes:</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<h2 id=\"daily-quote\">Daily Quote</h2>\n<h3 id=\"template-1\">Template</h3>\n<pre tabindex=\"0\"><code>&lt;% tp.web.daily_quote() %&gt;\n</code></pre><h3 id=\"output-example\">Output Example</h3>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<h3 id=\"plugins-used-1\">Plugins Used</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Templater</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"description-1\">Description</h3>\n<p>I like having a new quote at the top of each of my daily notes.

Here are what the 4 different parameters in the function do:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Format - sets the format for the date</li>\n<li>Offset - I keep this at 0 because I want the current date. 1 would give me tomorrow, -1 would give me yesterday.</li>\n<li>Reference - the date to use. If not provided, the function uses today&rsquo;s date when a note is created from it. I supply the file title here so that no matter <em>when</em> I make my daily note, the title in the note matches the file title. For example, I might create tomorrow&rsquo;s daily note ahead of time to start taking notes for tomorrow, so I want the file title to be the date used, NOT today&rsquo;s date during note creation.</li>\n<li>Reference format - the date format for #3</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"navigation\">Navigation</h2>\n<h3 id=\"template-3\">Template</h3>\n<pre tabindex=\"0\"><code>[[ &lt;% tp.date.now(&quot;YYYY-MM-DD&quot;, -1, tp.file.title, &quot;YYYY-MM-DD&quot;) %&gt; | ‚¨ÖÔ∏è Yesterday]] | [[&lt;% tp.date.now(&quot;YYYY-MM-DD&quot;, 1, tp.file.title, &quot;YYYY-MM-DD&quot;) %&gt; | ‚û°Ô∏è Tomorrow]] | [[&lt;% tp.date.now(&quot;YYYY-[w]WW&quot;, 0, tp.file.title, &quot;YYYY-MM-DD&quot;) %&gt; | üìñ Weekly]] | [[&lt;% tp.date.now(&quot;YYYY-MM&quot;, 0, tp.file.title, &quot;YYYY-MM-DD&quot;) %&gt; | üìÖ Monthly]]\n</code></pre><h3 id=\"output-example-2\">Output Example</h3>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<h3 id=\"plugins-used-3\">Plugins Used</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Templater</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"description-3\">Description</h3>\n<p>My navigation section consists of 4 links, each generated with Templater&rsquo;s <code>tp.date.now</code> function to match the title of another &ldquo;periodic&rdquo; note in my vault.</p>\n<p>The 4 links are:</p>\n<p><strong>Yesterday</strong></p>\n<pre tabindex=\"0\"><code>[[ &lt;% tp.date.now(&quot;YYYY-MM-DD&quot;, -1, tp.file.title, &quot;YYYY-MM-DD&quot;) %&gt; | ‚¨ÖÔ∏è Yesterday]]\n</code></pre><ul>\n<li>Use <code>tp.file.title</code> to get the date, offset -1 for yesterday</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Tomorrow</strong></p>\n<pre tabindex=\"0\"><code>[[&lt;% tp.date.now(&quot;YYYY-MM-DD&quot;, 1, tp.file.title, &quot;YYYY-MM-DD&quot;) %&gt; | ‚û°Ô∏è Tomorrow]]\n</code></pre><ul>\n<li>Use <code>tp.file.title</code> to get the date, offset +1 for tomorrow</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Weekly</strong></p>\n<pre tabindex=\"0\"><code>[[&lt;% tp.date.now(&quot;YYYY-[w]WW&quot;, 0, tp.file.title, &quot;YYYY-MM-DD&quot;) %&gt; | üìñ Weekly]]\n</code></pre><ul>\n<li>Use <code>tp.file.title</code> to get the date, format to my weekly note title format</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Monthly</strong></p>\n<pre tabindex=\"0\"><code>[[&lt;% tp.date.now(&quot;YYYY-MM&quot;, 0, tp.file.title, &quot;YYYY-MM-DD&quot;) %&gt; | üìÖ Monthly]]\n</code></pre><ul>\n<li>Use <code>tp.file.title</code> to get the date, format to my monthly note title format</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"daily-log\">Daily Log</h2>\n<h3 id=\"template-4\">Template</h3>\n<pre tabindex=\"0\"><code>```button\nname Add to Log\ntype command\naction QuickAdd: Capture to daily note\ncolor default\n```\n^button-rjgc\n\n## Daily Log\n\n</code></pre><h3 id=\"output-example-3\">Output Example</h3>\n<p>Empty state</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Adding a log with the button</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Example of added log</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<h3 id=\"plugins-used-4\">Plugins Used</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>QuickAdd</li>\n<li>Buttons</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"description-4\">Description</h3>\n<p>I like having a Daily Log section to rapid log tasks, ideas, notes, etc. throughout the day. I added a button to help me do this for two reasons:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I use Obsidian mobile, and often view notes in reading mode from my phone. Having the button allows me to quickly capture a log even from reading mode</li>\n<li>I like having a timestamp for my log entries. It forces a chronological log I can look back on.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I described how I configured the QuickAdd macro above in the <a href=\"#quickadd\">QuickAdd Plugin section</a>. Once the QuickAdd macro is configured, I can add the Button to my template and use the <code>command</code> type to call my QuickAdd macro.</p>\n<p>I do often add things to my daily note without using the &ldquo;Add to Log&rdquo; button. This section is where I create and store my tasks 97% of the time. That way, my task location is the daily note, so I can easily see the date it was created and I get the associated context of everything else stored in my daily note.</p>\n<h2 id=\"tasks-1\">Tasks</h2>\n<h3 id=\"template-5\">Template</h3>\n<pre tabindex=\"0\"><code>## [[Tasks Dashboard | Tasks]]\n\n&gt; [!overdue]+ Due before &lt;% tp.file.title %&gt;\n&gt; ```tasks\n&gt; due before &lt;% tp.date.now(&quot;YYYY-MM-DD&quot;, 0, tp.file.title, &quot;YYYY-MM-DD&quot;) %&gt;\n&gt; not done\n&gt; hide due date\n&gt; hide recurrence rule\n&gt; group by function task.tags.map( (tag) =&gt; tag.split('/')[1] ? tag.split('/').slice(0, 2).join('/') : '')\n&gt; ```\n\n&gt; [!due-today]+ Due &lt;% tp.file.title %&gt;\n&gt; ```tasks\n&gt; due &lt;% tp.date.now(&quot;YYYY-MM-DD&quot;, 0, tp.file.title, &quot;YYYY-MM-DD&quot;) %&gt;\n&gt; not done\n&gt; hide due date\n&gt; hide recurrence rule\n&gt; group by function task.tags.map( (tag) =&gt; tag.split('/')[1] ? tag.split('/').slice(0, 2).join('/') : '')\n\n&gt; [!coming-soon]- Due soon after &lt;% tp.file.title %&gt;\n&gt; ```tasks\n&gt; due after &lt;% tp.date.now(&quot;YYYY-MM-DD&quot;, 0, tp.file.title, &quot;YYYY-MM-DD&quot;) %&gt;\n&gt; due before &lt;% tp.date.now(&quot;YYYY-MM-DD&quot;, 4, tp.file.title, &quot;YYYY-MM-DD&quot;) %&gt;\n&gt; not done\n&gt; hide due date\n&gt; hide recurrence rule\n&gt; group by due\n&gt; group by function task.tags.map( (tag) =&gt; tag.split('/')[1] ? tag.split('/').slice(0, 2).join('/') : '')\n&gt; ```\n\n&gt; [!success]- Completed &lt;% tp.file.title %&gt;\n&gt; ```tasks\n&gt; done &lt;% tp.date.now(&quot;YYYY-MM-DD&quot;, 0, tp.file.title, &quot;YYYY-MM-DD&quot;) %&gt;\n&gt; short mode\n&gt; ```\n</code></pre><h3 id=\"output-example-4\">Output Example</h3>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<h3 id=\"plugins-used-5\">Plugins Used</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Templater</li>\n<li>Tasks</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"description-5\">Description</h3>\n<h4 id=\"setting-up-css-snippets-for-callout-styles\">Setting Up CSS Snippets for Callout Styles</h4>\n<p>Before I get into the task queries for the template, I&rsquo;ll mention that I use callouts to contain my task queries because I like the color-coded separation, and I like being able to collapse/expand my task lists. I have set up custom callout styles that I&rsquo;ve tailored to my task system. The default styles would work fine too, but you can set up custom styles with CSS Snippets.</p>\n<p>I followed the docs <a href=\"https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Callouts#Customize+callouts\">here</a> to get this set up.</p>\n<p>Under &ldquo;Appearance &gt; CSS Snippets&rdquo;, click the folder icon to open your snippets folder (.obsidian/snippets).</p>\n<p>In this location, create a file called callouts.css that contains the following:</p>\n<pre tabindex=\"0\"><code>.callout[data-callout=&quot;overdue&quot;] {\n¬† --callout-color: 255, 215, 0;\n¬† --callout-icon: alarm-clock;\n}\n\n.callout[data-callout=&quot;due-today&quot;] {\n¬† --callout-color: 12, 248, 161;\n¬† --callout-icon: check-square;\n}\n\n.callout[data-callout=&quot;coming-soon&quot;] {\n¬† --callout-color: 37, 202, 227;\n¬† --callout-icon: timer;\n}\n\n.callout[data-callout=&quot;next-two-weeks&quot;] {\n¬† --callout-color: 42, 165, 227;\n¬† --callout-icon: hourglass;\n}\n\n.callout[data-callout=&quot;later&quot;] {\n¬† --callout-color: 127, 128, 222;\n¬† --callout-icon: calendar;\n}\n\n.callout[data-callout=&quot;no-date&quot;] {\n¬† --callout-color: 163, 80, 250;\n¬† --callout-icon: calendar-off;\n}\n\n.callout[data-callout=&quot;recurring&quot;] {\n¬† --callout-color: 216, 191, 216;\n¬† --callout-icon: repeat;\n}\n\n.callout[data-callout=&quot;personal&quot;] {\n¬† --callout-color: 240, 240, 240;\n¬† --callout-icon: user;\n}\n\n.callout[data-callout=&quot;work&quot;] {\n¬† --callout-color: 240, 240, 240;\n¬† --callout-icon: briefcase;\n}\n</code></pre><p>Go back to &ldquo;Appearance &gt; CSS Snippets&rdquo; and click the refresh icon to reload the snippets into Obsidian&rsquo;s styles.</p>\n<p>Now you can use these callout type identifiers to style your callouts. These are the custom callout types I use to contain different types of tasks. I don&rsquo;t use all of these in my daily note, some show up in other places like my Tasks Dashboard.</p>\n<h4 id=\"grouping-tasks\">Grouping Tasks</h4>\n<p>For my daily note, I like my task queries to show tasks in a certain date range (e.g., overdue, due today, due in the next 3 days, completed today) and then within the query, I like to group my tasks by whether they are related to work, personal, or uncategorized. I use tags to assign my tasks to projects, so I look at the tag to determine which group a task should fall into.</p>\n<p>My tag structure for organizing tasks has three sections: <code>#{prefix}/{area}/{project}</code>. An example tag would be: <code>#p/personal/website</code>. I prefix all project tags with <code>p/</code> so that I can quickly pull them all up in the typeahead menu when I start typing a tag.

				"content_text": "I use my [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) daily note as my main digital jumping-off point for things like:\n\n- habits\n- daily log\n- tasks\n- journaling\n\nI've gathered ideas for setting this up from all over the internet over many months, and unfortunately, I don't recall all the resources I used. [Dann Berg's post](https://dannb.org/blog/2022/obsidian-daily-note-template/) inspired my \"Today's Notes\" section, and I first learned a lot about Obsidian from [Nick Milo's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@linkingyourthinking).\n \nBelow I outline what my template looks like, and how I set it up.\n \n# Table of Contents\n\n- [Overview](#overview)\n- [Plugins](#plugins)\n\t- [Daily Notes and Periodic Notes](#daily-notes-and-periodic-notes)\n\t- [Templater](#templater)\n\t- [Dataview](#dataview)\n\t- [Tasks](#tasks)\n\t- [QuickAdd](#quickadd)\n\t- [Buttons](#buttons)\n\t- [Calendar](#calendar)\n- [The Template](#the-template)\n\t- [Frontmatter Habits](#frontmatter-habits)\n\t- [Daily Quote](#daily-quote)\n\t- [Title](#title)\n\t- [Navigation](#navigation)\n\t- [Daily Log](#daily-log)\n\t- [Tasks](#tasks-1)\n\t- [5 Minute Journal](#5-minute-journal)\n\t- [Today's Notes](#todays-notes)\n- [Final Thoughts](#final-thoughts)\n\n# Overview\n\nMy template allows me to have the same daily note created for me each day. Here's what it looks like:\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2024/obsidian-daily-note-1.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"1902\" alt=\"Example of Jake's full daily note template\">\n\nI'll talk more about each individual section later in this post, but overall this daily note has helped me to become more organized and focused. Its primary purpose is managing tasks and rapidly logging notes throughout the day. Having one place to collect both tasks and quick notes has been helpful for me. A nice perk of doing it in Obsidian is that those quick notes can easily evolve into standalone markdown files if they need to, but the key is having a really *low friction* place to capture a thought or task.\n\nHaving my daily note link to other \"periodic\" notes (daily, weekly, monthly) feels very Obsidian-ish, but truth be told I don't use the links too often. They are nice when I need them though, like quickly needing to get to something I logged yesterday.\n\nI used to use the 5 Minute Journal section more than I do now, but this has been replaced by analog journaling. I sort of miss having this stored digitally, and I'm sure I could hack together some awesome digital journal dashboard with Dataview, but that's not really the point, is it? Journaling analog helps me to slow down and really reflect, which seems to make my individual sessions more meaningful. And that's what I'm really looking for. All that being said, I do still like using the 5-Minute Journal occasionally when I'm feeling scattered and need a quick dose of mindfulness while at my computer.\n\nThe Today's Notes section is another one I don't use too often, but it's fun to have. I'm not using it to navigate between notes I'm currently working on that day, because Obsidian has great navigation features I'm using instead (e.g., tabs, search). But I do like having it whenever I take a look at past daily notes. It's fun to see a snapshot of what I worked on any given day, and the combination of the daily log, completed tasks, and Today's Notes paints a nice picture of what I was doing and thinking.\n\n# Plugins\n\n## Daily Notes and Periodic Notes\n\nThese plugins both can create a daily note from a specified template file. Periodic Notes allows the creation of some additional types of notes, like weekly, monthly, quarterly, and yearly. \n\nI prefer to keep my daily notes in their own folder, and each daily note's title is formatted as `YYYY-MM-DD`.\n\nI keep my template file in \"Bins/Templates/Daily Note\".\n\nHere's my config for Daily Notes:\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2024/obsidian-daily-note-2.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"268\" alt=\"\">\n\nHere's my config for Periodic Notes (you'll see I also use weekly and monthly notes, which I link to from my daily note):\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2024/obsidian-daily-note-3.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"452\" alt=\"\">\n\n## Templater\n\nWith Templater, if I create a file from a template, either manually or through Daily Notes or Periodic Notes, I can run some code from my template *when the template is instantiated*. This allows me to get things like the current date, daily quote, date ranges for tasks, and file title at the time when I use the template.\n\nYou can even use Templater to run your own JavaScript during note creation, but I am not using that in the current iteration of my daily notes template.\n\nHere is my current config for Templater:\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2024/obsidian-daily-note-4.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"477\" alt=\"\">\n\nThe two important parts are:\n\n1. Specify a template folder (I use \"Bins/Templates\")\n2. Trigger Templater on new file creation. You want this on so that Templater works with Daily Notes and Periodic Notes.\n\nI use Templater all over my daily note template, and anything between `<% ... %>` is Templater syntax.\n\n## Dataview\n\nDataview is a powerful way to query data across all of your notes in your Obsidian vault. For my daily note, I use it to display any notes I created or modified that day.\n\nI don't believe I did anything unique with the config for Dataview, much of the setup is for viewing preference.\n\n## Tasks\n\nObsidian is the main place I track tasks digitally, and I use the Tasks plugin to do that. My full setup with Tasks warrants a separate post, but for my daily note I use it to capture tasks in my Daily Log and to display tasks that are:\n\n- overdue\n- due today\n- coming soon (next 3 days)\n- completed today\n\nI haven't changed much from the default Tasks config. I just have it configured to add a \"done date\" each time I complete a task.\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2024/pasted-image-20240119172358.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"316\" alt=\"\">\n\n## QuickAdd\n\nQuickAdd allows running macros from anywhere in Obsidian. I have a macro setup that can be run from anywhere and allows me to quickly write up text that gets appended at the top of my Daily Log with the current timestamp.\n\nTo configure this I created a macro called \"Capture to daily note\" in QuickAdd:\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2024/obsidian-daily-note-5.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"302\" alt=\"QuickAdd settings config\">\n\nIn the settings for that macro, I tell it where to add the text, and how to create the Daily Note if it has not already been created:\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2024/obsidian-daily-note-6.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"643\" alt=\"macro settings config\">\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2024/pasted-image-20240119172535.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"517\" alt=\"\">\n\nTo summarize, QuickAdd looks for today's daily note, and then inserts my supplied text after the header I supplied, which is `## Daily Log`, and gives it some special formatting that I specify near the bottom of the settings. More on this in the Daily Log Section.\n\n## Buttons\n\nButtons allows you to place buttons in your notes that can run macros. I use a button in my daily note templated to run the QuickAdd macro I described above. This allows me to really quickly capture a short note to my daily log, even if I am viewing my Daily Note on reading mode (which is something I end up doing often from mobile).\n\n## Calendar\n\nI use the calendar plugin to navigate between my daily and weekly notes, and to create them. \n\n# The Template\n\nYou can get the full template from this [Gist on Github](https://gist.github.com/jakeweidokal/027072dc75ddc77ec9595739808db592). Below I'll break down the template by section so you can take only the pieces and parts you need.\n\n## Frontmatter Habits\n\n### Template\n\n```\n---\nweek: <% tp.date.now('ww',0, tp.file.title, 'YYYY-MM-DD') %>\nweight:\nstartEating:\nendEating:\ntags: daily\n---\n```\n\n### Plugins Used\n\n- Templater\n\n### Description\n\nFor my habits section, I use the YAML frontmatter of the markdown file to track any daily habits. I use Templater to get the week number and save it as a property. I also use the Frontmatter to tag all daily notes with the `#daily` tag.  After that, all additional front matter fields are used to track daily metrics, which could be things like weight, times, mood, etc. \n\nTo be honest, I don't use this much anymore, but it was useful when I was doing intermittent fasting. I was eating within an 8 hour window each day, so I used this section to track when I started eating, when I stopped eating, and my weight. Then, with this data stored in each daily note, I used the Obsidian Charts plugin in my weekly and monthly notes to trend my progress over time. If you are interested in how this is setup, shoot me an email and let me know.\n\nExample of Obsidian Charts in one of my monthly notes:\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2024/obsidian-daily-note-7.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"308\" alt=\"Obsidian chart showing weight and eating windows charted over a month\">\n\n## Daily Quote\n\n### Template\n\n```\n<% tp.web.daily_quote() %>\n```\n\n### Output Example\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2024/obsidian-daily-note-8.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"104\" alt=\"A quote from peter drucker that says the best way to predict your future is to create it\">\n\n### Plugins Used\n\n- Templater\n\n### Description\n\nI like having a new quote at the top of each of my daily notes. Templater has a built-in function I use that returns the quote of the day when the template is instantiated.\n\n## Title\n\n### Template\n\n```\n# <% tp.date.now(\"dddd, MMMM Do YYYY\", 0, tp.file.title, \"YYYY-MM-DD\") %>\n```\n\n### Output Example\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2024/obsidian-daily-note-9.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"85\" alt=\"a screesnhot showing the text Friday, January 19th 2024\">\n\n### Plugins Used\n\n- Templater\n\n### Description\n\nAll my daily notes have a file title in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`, but I like having a more readable format that includes the weekday.\n\nI use the `tp.date.now` function to format the date from the title of the file. Here are what the 4 different parameters in the function do:\n\n1. Format - sets the format for the date\n2. Offset - I keep this at 0 because I want the current date. 1 would give me tomorrow, -1 would give me yesterday.\n3. Reference - the date to use. If not provided, the function uses today's date when a note is created from it. I supply the file title here so that no matter *when* I make my daily note, the title in the note matches the file title. For example, I might create tomorrow's daily note ahead of time to start taking notes for tomorrow, so I want the file title to be the date used, NOT today's date during note creation.\n4. Reference format - the date format for #3\n\n## Navigation\n\n### Template\n\n```\n[[ <% tp.date.now(\"YYYY-MM-DD\", -1, tp.file.title, \"YYYY-MM-DD\") %> | ‚¨ÖÔ∏è Yesterday]] | [[<% tp.date.now(\"YYYY-MM-DD\", 1, tp.file.title, \"YYYY-MM-DD\") %> | ‚û°Ô∏è Tomorrow]] | [[<% tp.date.now(\"YYYY-[w]WW\", 0, tp.file.title, \"YYYY-MM-DD\") %> | üìñ Weekly]] | [[<% tp.date.now(\"YYYY-MM\", 0, tp.file.title, \"YYYY-MM-DD\") %> | üìÖ Monthly]]\n```\n\n### Output Example\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2024/obsidian-daily-note-10.png\" width=\"342\" height=\"21\" alt=\"Markdown links for yesterday, tomorrow, weekly, monthly\">\n\n### Plugins Used\n\n- Templater\n\n### Description\n\nMy navigation section consists of 4 links, each generated with Templater's `tp.date.now` function to match the title of another \"periodic\" note in my vault.\n\nThe 4 links are:\n\n**Yesterday**\n\n```\n[[ <% tp.date.now(\"YYYY-MM-DD\", -1, tp.file.title, \"YYYY-MM-DD\") %> | ‚¨ÖÔ∏è Yesterday]]\n```\n\n- Use `tp.file.title` to get the date, offset -1 for yesterday\n\n**Tomorrow**\n\n```\n[[<% tp.date.now(\"YYYY-MM-DD\", 1, tp.file.title, \"YYYY-MM-DD\") %> | ‚û°Ô∏è Tomorrow]]\n```\n\n- Use `tp.file.title` to get the date, offset +1 for tomorrow\n\n**Weekly**\n\n```\n[[<% tp.date.now(\"YYYY-[w]WW\", 0, tp.file.title, \"YYYY-MM-DD\") %> | üìñ Weekly]]\n```\n\n- Use `tp.file.title` to get the date, format to my weekly note title format\n\n**Monthly**\n\n```\n[[<% tp.date.now(\"YYYY-MM\", 0, tp.file.title, \"YYYY-MM-DD\") %> | üìÖ Monthly]]\n```\n\n- Use `tp.file.title` to get the date, format to my monthly note title format\n\n## Daily Log\n\n### Template\n\n````\n```button\nname Add to Log\ntype command\naction QuickAdd: Capture to daily note\ncolor default\n```\n^button-rjgc\n\n## Daily Log\n\n````\n\n### Output Example\n\nEmpty state\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2024/obsidian-daily-note-11.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"117\" alt=\"\">\n\nAdding a log with the button\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2024/obsidian-daily-note-12.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"124\" alt=\"\">\n\nExample of added log\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2024/obsidian-daily-note-13.png\" width=\"593\" height=\"150\" alt=\"\">\n\n### Plugins Used\n\n- QuickAdd\n- Buttons\n\n### Description\n\nI like having a Daily Log section to rapid log tasks, ideas, notes, etc. throughout the day. I added a button to help me do this for two reasons:\n\n1. I use Obsidian mobile, and often view notes in reading mode from my phone. Having the button allows me to quickly capture a log even from reading mode\n2. I like having a timestamp for my log entries. It forces a chronological log I can look back on.\n\nI described how I configured the QuickAdd macro above in the [QuickAdd Plugin section](#quickadd). Once the QuickAdd macro is configured, I can add the Button to my template and use the `command` type to call my QuickAdd macro. \n\nI do often add things to my daily note without using the \"Add to Log\" button. This section is where I create and store my tasks 97% of the time. That way, my task location is the daily note, so I can easily see the date it was created and I get the associated context of everything else stored in my daily note.\n\n\n## Tasks\n\n### Template\n\n```\n## [[Tasks Dashboard | Tasks]]\n\n> [!overdue]+ Due before <% tp.file.title %>\n> ```tasks\n> due before <% tp.date.now(\"YYYY-MM-DD\", 0, tp.file.title, \"YYYY-MM-DD\") %>\n> not done\n> hide due date\n> hide recurrence rule\n> group by function task.tags.map( (tag) => tag.split('/')[1] ? tag.split('/').slice(0, 2).join('/') : '')\n> ```\n\n> [!due-today]+ Due <% tp.file.title %>\n> ```tasks\n> due <% tp.date.now(\"YYYY-MM-DD\", 0, tp.file.title, \"YYYY-MM-DD\") %>\n> not done\n> hide due date\n> hide recurrence rule\n> group by function task.tags.map( (tag) => tag.split('/')[1] ? tag.split('/').slice(0, 2).join('/') : '')\n\n> [!coming-soon]- Due soon after <% tp.file.title %>\n> ```tasks\n> due after <% tp.date.now(\"YYYY-MM-DD\", 0, tp.file.title, \"YYYY-MM-DD\") %>\n> due before <% tp.date.now(\"YYYY-MM-DD\", 4, tp.file.title, \"YYYY-MM-DD\") %>\n> not done\n> hide due date\n> hide recurrence rule\n> group by due\n> group by function task.tags.map( (tag) => tag.split('/')[1] ? tag.split('/').slice(0, 2).join('/') : '')\n> ```\n\n> [!success]- Completed <% tp.file.title %>\n> ```tasks\n> done <% tp.date.now(\"YYYY-MM-DD\", 0, tp.file.title, \"YYYY-MM-DD\") %>\n> short mode\n> ```\n```\n\n### Output Example\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2024/obsidian-daily-note-14.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"1658\" alt=\"Multiple tasks lists for overdue, due today, coming soon, and completed\">\n\n### Plugins Used\n\n- Templater\n- Tasks\n\n### Description\n\n#### Setting Up CSS Snippets for Callout Styles\n\nBefore I get into the task queries for the template, I'll mention that I use callouts to contain my task queries because I like the color-coded separation, and I like being able to collapse/expand my task lists. I have set up custom callout styles that I've tailored to my task system. The default styles would work fine too, but you can set up custom styles with CSS Snippets. \n\nI followed the docs [here](https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Callouts#Customize+callouts) to get this set up.\n\nUnder \"Appearance > CSS Snippets\", click the folder icon to open your snippets folder (.obsidian/snippets).\n\nIn this location, create a file called callouts.css that contains the following:\n\n```\n.callout[data-callout=\"overdue\"] {\n¬† --callout-color: 255, 215, 0;\n¬† --callout-icon: alarm-clock;\n}\n\n.callout[data-callout=\"due-today\"] {\n¬† --callout-color: 12, 248, 161;\n¬† --callout-icon: check-square;\n}\n\n.callout[data-callout=\"coming-soon\"] {\n¬† --callout-color: 37, 202, 227;\n¬† --callout-icon: timer;\n}\n\n.callout[data-callout=\"next-two-weeks\"] {\n¬† --callout-color: 42, 165, 227;\n¬† --callout-icon: hourglass;\n}\n\n.callout[data-callout=\"later\"] {\n¬† --callout-color: 127, 128, 222;\n¬† --callout-icon: calendar;\n}\n\n.callout[data-callout=\"no-date\"] {\n¬† --callout-color: 163, 80, 250;\n¬† --callout-icon: calendar-off;\n}\n\n.callout[data-callout=\"recurring\"] {\n¬† --callout-color: 216, 191, 216;\n¬† --callout-icon: repeat;\n}\n\n.callout[data-callout=\"personal\"] {\n¬† --callout-color: 240, 240, 240;\n¬† --callout-icon: user;\n}\n\n.callout[data-callout=\"work\"] {\n¬† --callout-color: 240, 240, 240;\n¬† --callout-icon: briefcase;\n}\n```\n\nGo back to \"Appearance > CSS Snippets\" and click the refresh icon to reload the snippets into Obsidian's styles. \n\nNow you can use these callout type identifiers to style your callouts. These are the custom callout types I use to contain different types of tasks. I don't use all of these in my daily note, some show up in other places like my Tasks Dashboard.\n\n#### Grouping Tasks\n\nFor my daily note, I like my task queries to show tasks in a certain date range (e.g., overdue, due today, due in the next 3 days, completed today) and then within the query, I like to group my tasks by whether they are related to work, personal, or uncategorized. I use tags to assign my tasks to projects, so I look at the tag to determine which group a task should fall into.\n\nMy tag structure for organizing tasks has three sections: `#{prefix}/{area}/{project}`. An example tag would be: `#p/personal/website`. I prefix all project tags with `p/` so that I can quickly pull them all up in the typeahead menu when I start typing a tag. The second part of the tag is the area that the project belongs to, which is either \"work\" or \"personal\" in my setup. This is what I like to group my tasks on.\n\nTo accomplish this, at the end of my tasks query I have:\n\n```\ngroup by function task.tags.map( (tag) => tag.split('/')[1] ? tag.split('/').slice(0, 2).join('/') : '')\n```\n\nHere's what this is doing for each task:\n\n- it looks to see, \"Does this task have a tag with an area section?\"\n- if it does, it cuts off the project from the end, and returns the area like: `#{prefix}/{area}`\n- if it does not, it returns empty\n\nSo then my tasks fall into one of 3 groups:\n\n1. Personal\n2. Work\n3.

I like being able to trace this history where I can go back to a daily note and see what I was working on in Obsidian that day. \n\nThe logic for Created Today is show files that:\n\n- were created on or after today at 12AM\n- were created on or before tomorrow at 12AM\n- except for this daily note\n\nThe logic for Modified Today is show files that:\n\n- were modified on or after today at 12AM\n- were modified on or before tomorrow at 12AM\n- except for this daily note\n\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nI hope this helps you with setting up your own Daily Note template! I took inspiration from many places to put this together, and I hope to give back to the Obsidian community by sharing how I use my Daily Note. It is where I spend at least 80% of my time in Obsidian.\n",

Or will my values and beliefs be changed?</p>\n<p>It feels more like the latter, but I have no idea how that will play out.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I have found it to be true that my values have shifted some.

Having a baby has been very uniting, but also brings about a number of disagreements over strongly held opinions on parenting. So far, we have centered around &ldquo;safety&rdquo; as our tiebreaker to determine which opinion we should go with when we can&rsquo;t come to agreement through talking about it. It is interesting that so many of our opinions are rooted in our own childhood experiences, so in a lot of our disagreements it is more important to empathize with each other about past experiences than to rationalize about the current situation. When we empathize, we both tend to feel much better about the approach we decide on. The core to all of this is a mutual understanding that we are on the same team, and we both want the best for our daughter, even when we are coming at it from different angles.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Less time to myself</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Finding time for <em>me</em> has become much more challenging. The only alone time I&rsquo;ve found has come early in the morning, before the girls are awake.

It has been very refreshing for me to get up around 4:30 or 5:00, make a warm cup of coffee, and then either journal, read a book, or work on a personal project. I&rsquo;d like to incorporate more exercise into my &ldquo;me time&rdquo;, but the time feels so short and I&rsquo;m having way more fun doing stuff like writing this post.

Somehow it feels wasteful, and I&rsquo;m surprised I could feel guilty about something so trivial. I try to remind myself that whitespace has value too. It brings separation, clarity.

In fact, since making this change, part of me still feels guilty for taking up more space on the page with each word. Somehow it feels wasteful, and I'm surprised I could feel guilty about something so trivial. I try to remind myself that whitespace has value too. It brings separation, clarity. It lays the canvas from which each character or word is defined. Having too much ink smushed together muddles everything up. Each stroke is only as good as the accompanying whitespace that makes it a stroke at all.\n\nAs I think about whitespace in a literal sense and how it has improved my writing, it makes me wonder about whitespace in a figurative sense. Are there areas in my life where I am trying too hard to cram \"stuff\" together, and a little whitespace might bring separation and clarity? What does whitespace even mean, in that sense?\n",
