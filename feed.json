				"content_html": "<p>Today I found myself in the downtown area of an old, little rural Ohio town. Surrounded by brick buildings, with a large, antiquated concrete community bank on the opposite corner. I stopped in at a local Chinese takeout place with my family for lunch. We ordered our food, and were told the customary &ldquo;10 minutes&rdquo;. While waiting for them to prepare our food, I stepped out onto the corner with my daughter.</p>\n<p>It was&hellip; unremarkable. Another typical Ohio day in a quaint Ohio town.</p>\n<p>But doing unremarkable things with a one year-old can suddenly make them remarkable.</p>\n<p>My daughter stared in amazement at the cars going by, talking and waving to each one. She looked one way down the sidewalk and squealed, then turned around quickly and squealed in the other direction. She looked up and squinted as the sun shone on her face and the wind blew her bangs around.</p>\n<p>And then strangely, I began to see and hear what was around me. I suppose I am always doing this, but there was something special about being acutely <em>aware</em> of my seeing and my hearing.</p>\n<p>I suddenly saw the cars not as background movement, but as amazing marvels of engineering, each unique from the next. I saw the people in them. I saw how focused they were. I imagined their destination, their origin, their goals, their lives. Each so focused on their own. As I usually am.</p>\n<p>I saw the buildings around me. I imagined their history. The tenants that each had their moment in the space. The decades of daily visitors passing in and out.</p>\n<p>I saw the stop lights. Their simple design. Their rigid schedule.

				"content_text": "Today I found myself in the downtown area of an old, little rural Ohio town. Surrounded by brick buildings, with a large, antiquated concrete community bank on the opposite corner. I stopped in at a local Chinese takeout place with my family for lunch. We ordered our food, and were told the customary \"10 minutes\". While waiting for them to prepare our food, I stepped out onto the corner with my daughter.\n\nIt was... unremarkable. Another typical Ohio day in a quaint Ohio town.\n\nBut doing unremarkable things with a one year-old can suddenly make them remarkable. <!--more-->My daughter stared in amazement at the cars going by, talking and waving to each one. She looked one way down the sidewalk and squealed, then turned around quickly and squealed in the other direction. She looked up and squinted as the sun shone on her face and the wind blew her bangs around.\n\nAnd then strangely, I began to see and hear what was around me. I suppose I am always doing this, but there was something special about being acutely _aware_ of my seeing and my hearing.\n\nI suddenly saw the cars not as background movement, but as amazing marvels of engineering, each unique from the next. I saw the people in them. I saw how focused they were. I imagined their destination, their origin, their goals, their lives. Each so focused on their own. As I usually am.\n\nI saw the buildings around me. I imagined their history. The tenants that each had their moment in the space. The decades of daily visitors passing in and out.\n\nI saw the stop lights. Their simple design. Their rigid schedule. Easily understood.\n\nI smelled the scent of the Chinese restaurant wafting out the door behind me. I heard construction in the distance and cars whooshing by. I felt on my back the gritty texture of the concrete pillar that I leaned against.\n\nI felt what my daughter felt. Not with touch, but with my whole self. I stepped into her joy and her excitement. I looked into her eyes and giggled with her. I squealed at the sidewalk. I waved at the cars.\n\nI transformed from agent to observer. I had no goal in that moment. I simply observed. It was nice. I felt like a little fly on the wall of my tiny corner of the universe, watching time and space move around me.\n\nUsually I move through the world as if I _am_ the universe. My thoughts blind me from what is around me. My thoughts seem to be all that exists. It's a lot being the universe. It's relaxing to not be the universe. To merely be part of it. Especially if you can be part of it with someone you love.\n\nSo grab someone you love and go stand on a street corner and look around.\n\n\n",

				"title": "26 Pieces Of Advice To My Past Self",
				"content_html": "<p>I recently turned 26. I&rsquo;m no sage, but I&rsquo;ve picked up a couple of lessons in my time. Below are 26 things I would tell a younger me if I could.</p>\n<p><strong>1</strong> Read more material that endures. Posts and videos are ephemeral. They come and go. Seek out knowledge and stories that have survived years, decades, or centuries.</p>\n<p><strong>2</strong> Write as much as you can. Write anything. Document your days. You&rsquo;ll love flipping through old journal entries, and seeing what you were doing. Trap your anxious and messy thoughts on paper, so they don&rsquo;t consume your mind. When confronted with something hard, think through it in writing. It will slow you down, and allow you to evaluate your thoughts more clearly.</p>\n<p><strong>3</strong> You have an aversion to conflict. You can feel it in your bones. That&rsquo;s okay. Stay in it, and realize there are many ways to work through conflict. Guide the conflict into a style that you do well with. Conflict can be important, so do not avoid it when it is necessary. Stay calm and explain yourself clearly, even if you need to tremble through it.</p>\n<p><strong>4</strong> You have a guilty conscience. This is good because it means you have a sense of morality but beware of people who will try to use that against you. If someone or something is making you feel guilty, pay close attention to the motives.</p>\n<p><strong>5</strong> Smile, make eye contact, and when you ask someone how they are, really ask them.</p>\n<p><strong>6</strong> The world is lonely without a community that shares your values. As soon as you realize you do not have this, find it. Or make it.</p>\n<p><strong>7</strong> You can become a good public speaker. Like conflict, you feel like you need to run from it, but the truth is you must do exactly the opposite. Seek out opportunities to speak in front of others. It will be uncomfortable, but the more you do it, the better you will get. And absolutely practice beforehand, winging it is a terrible idea.</p>\n<p><strong>8</strong> Stay open. Much of the good in your life will come from opportunities you didn&rsquo;t foresee at all and had no control over. You might miss them if you keep too tight a grip on what you think you need.</p>\n<p><strong>9</strong> Related to the above, don&rsquo;t forget how much you owe to God and luck. You think you know this, but you cannot comprehend its depth.</p>\n<p><strong>10</strong> Remember that every lie you tell will be accompanied by a confession, or worse, an exposure. Think of this anytime you consider lying, and do not do it. Lying is like smoking, it builds up tar in your soul.</p>\n<p><strong>11</strong> Remember that it&rsquo;s temporary. In the midst of anxiety, it will feel all-consuming and never-ending. It isn&rsquo;t so. It will end.</p>\n<p><strong>12</strong> Everybody is fascinating if you ask. So ask, then listen.</p>\n<p><strong>13</strong> Initiate connection in your marriage daily. It will not initiate itself.</p>\n<p><strong>14</strong> Step up and lead. Getting everyone&rsquo;s opinion and deciding by majority may feel inclusive, but it is not leading. You will need to make tough, uncomfortable, and even unpopular calls. Make them and then bear them.</p>\n<p><strong>15</strong> You so desire to be better that you will have a tendency to believe all feedback you receive. Some feedback is neither valid nor helpful. Don&rsquo;t get stirred up over it. Recognize it for what it is, and move on.</p>\n<p><strong>16</strong> Say what you want. Especially to your managers at work. People don&rsquo;t know what you want if you don&rsquo;t tell them. Most people will try to help you get what you want if they know what it is.</p>\n<p><strong>17</strong> Never disbelieve in what you are capable of. You will learn to love olives. And you will become a master diaper changer. If you can do those, you can do anything.</p>\n<p><strong>18</strong> Nourish your curiosity. You do a good job of exploring new things and not caring so much if others think they&rsquo;re weird. In fact, relish in the confused gaze you get when you tell people about your new abstract hobby or interest. Keep doing that.</p>\n<p><strong>19</strong> You follow rules really well. Try breaking them more.</p>\n<p><strong>20</strong> Just because everyone is doing it, does not mean it&rsquo;s good for you. You are allowed to completely cut yourself off from things that are not good for you.</p>\n<p><strong>21</strong> Don&rsquo;t get too obsessed with being better or doing better. You&rsquo;ll lose sight of now, which is bad because it&rsquo;s always now. Be present. Accept what is.</p>\n<p><strong>22</strong> Start developing habits to maintain your health. Your high metabolism will not last forever, and avoiding the doctor will only cause more problems later. Get a primary care physician, see a dermatologist, and keep up with the dentist.</p>\n<p><strong>23</strong> Don&rsquo;t be ashamed of your age. People use age as a proxy for competence and trustworthiness, so these assumptions will not be given to you easily. Be honest about who you are, and what you are, and lean into your strengths. Wherever you are, you are there for a reason, even if you feel out of place.</p>\n<p><strong>24</strong> Please take yourself less seriously. Not everything needs to be about &ldquo;finding signal&rdquo; or doing better. Have fun and be goofy. Don&rsquo;t forget how to take it easy, this seems to get a little harder for you each year.</p>\n<p><strong>25</strong> Go to bed earlier and wake up earlier. It&rsquo;s amazing how much better life feels this way.</p>\n<p><strong>26</strong> Be less selfish. Think of others more, and make a system to do so if it does not come naturally.</p>",

This is a simple tool that would be a good introduction for folks who haven&rsquo;t been using AI much.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.perplexity.ai/\">Perplexity AI</a> is a conversational AI assistant and search engine that provides citations for sources it is using.

Analog thoughts are methodical and more planned out. Each word, each sentence, gets much more thought. There is no turning back.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s so fun to see where thoughts lead me. I thought this would be an entry about busyness and distraction, but my mind seems more stuck on the difference between digital and analog mediums for thought exploration. Having a medium to capture your thoughts is useful, but how does the medium shape your thoughts? Is it better to be able to edit and rearrange your thoughts easily, or is it better, to follow a slow, linear progression? Or is it just different? If I had written this digitally, I might have edited the first paragraph to have a smoother segue, but I would have lost the original idea that led me to where I am now. Analog forces a full historical record. It takes a longer time to adjust course or backtrack, but you won&rsquo;t lose where you started. How many beautiful, half-baked thoughts have been lost in the editing phase of digital writing? Yet on the other side of the coin, dead branches should be pruned so that the healthy ones can grow stronger.</p>\n<p>It would be nice to have the benefits of both analog and digital. I need someone to build a small microwave-style device that scans a notebook in its entirety, and then some sort of local, air-gapped Al separates and tags the content appropriately, moving it to my note app of choice. A dreamer has to dream. The major downfall of analog is how hard it is to re-surface at a later time. There are indexing and categorization systems that help with this, but they don&rsquo;t come close to what I can do digitally.</p>\n<p>The experience of writing something new is so nice in analog though. Flip to an empty page, grab your writing utensil, and get going. I get the physical feedback of the pen, the sound of each stroke on the page, and my writing style is distinctly &ldquo;mine&rdquo;. I contrast that with my phone, where I feel obligated to read each notification before I get started writing. That is, if I even make it there without getting lost chasing a squirrel. It&rsquo;s not as good with a laptop either. I have to pull it out, boot it up, find my app, and make my way to a blank space for writing. It&rsquo;s not too much longer, but it feels so much further away than pen and paper.</p>\n<p>This sounds a bit like digital-bashing, but I prefer it in many cases. I&rsquo;ve just been spending too much time there recently, and not enough time with my pen and paper. Here&rsquo;s to more time with my ad-free journal.</p>",

I thought this would be an entry about busyness and distraction, but my mind seems more stuck on the difference between digital and analog mediums for thought exploration. Having a medium to capture your thoughts is useful, but how does the medium shape your thoughts? Is it better to be able to edit and rearrange your thoughts easily, or is it better, to follow a slow, linear progression? Or is it just different? If I had written this digitally, I might have edited the first paragraph to have a smoother segue, but I would have lost the original idea that led me to where I am now. Analog forces a full historical record. It takes a longer time to adjust course or backtrack, but you won't lose where you started. How many beautiful, half-baked thoughts have been lost in the editing phase of digital writing? Yet on the other side of the coin, dead branches should be pruned so that the healthy ones can grow stronger.\n\nIt would be nice to have the benefits of both analog and digital. I need someone to build a small microwave-style device that scans a notebook in its entirety, and then some sort of local, air-gapped Al separates and tags the content appropriately, moving it to my note app of choice. A dreamer has to dream. The major downfall of analog is how hard it is to re-surface at a later time. There are indexing and categorization systems that help with this, but they don't come close to what I can do digitally.\n\nThe experience of writing something new is so nice in analog though. Flip to an empty page, grab your writing utensil, and get going. I get the physical feedback of the pen, the sound of each stroke on the page, and my writing style is distinctly \"mine\". I contrast that with my phone, where I feel obligated to read each notification before I get started writing. That is, if I even make it there without getting lost chasing a squirrel. It's not as good with a laptop either. I have to pull it out, boot it up, find my app, and make my way to a blank space for writing. It's not too much longer, but it feels so much further away than pen and paper.\n\nThis sounds a bit like digital-bashing, but I prefer it in many cases. I've just been spending too much time there recently, and not enough time with my pen and paper. Here's to more time with my ad-free journal.\n",

Right now, you can specify an origin as either a NASA Center or an Airport. In the future, I plan to provide other predefined origins for agencies other than NASA.

There are two options for adding destinations:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Add bulk destinations from a preset (currently the only option is All NASA Centers.

Fed Meetup will run its calculations and provide you with a ranked list of destinations from cheapest to most expensive. If a direct flight can not be found for an origin-destination pair, that destination is ranked lower in the results and marked with an asterisk to indicate the total cost does not include airfare for that origin-destination pair.

The campaign was looking for existing tools that could be used to evaluate the best meeting locations for large meetings, specifically using federal city-pair and per diem rates. No such tool existed, so I decided to build my own. I was looking for a fun side project that was useful, so this was a great fit! All-in it took me about 15 hours to build this app. I&rsquo;m proud that I was able to get it completed within the two-week timeframe I had before the Spark campaign closed, but there is a lot that I would like to improve.</p>\n<h3 id=\"future-plans\">Future Plans</h3>\n<p>Remember how NASA was only 0.3% of the federal budget?

				"content_html": "<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;They see they can and must stand up, because they begin to understand how genuinely monstrous they will become, otherwise, feeding on their resentment, transforming it into the most destructive of wishes. To say it again: There is very little difference between the capacity for mayhem and destruction, integrated, and strength of character. This is one of the most difficult lessons of life.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>- <a href=\"https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/\">Jordan B. Peterson</a>, <a href=\"https://a.co/d/5q4bKF2\">12 Rules for Life</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To be good, you must be dangerous.</p>\n<p>Much of my life, I equated dangerous with bad. But I have come to realize that a chief aim of the good ought to be to increase their dangerousness. This is necessary when operating in and around evil.</p>\n<p>A capacity for evil is not inherently bad. Your capacity is morally neutral, but it is up to you to wield it appropriately. C.S. Lewis illustrates this well when answering the question of why there is evil at all:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;‘Why did God make a creature of such rotten stuff that it went wrong?’ The better stuff a creature is made of—the cleverer and stronger and freer it is—then the better it will be if it goes right, but also the worse it will be if it goes wrong.

				"content_text": "> \"They see they can and must stand up, because they begin to understand how genuinely monstrous they will become, otherwise, feeding on their resentment, transforming it into the most destructive of wishes. To say it again: There is very little difference between the capacity for mayhem and destruction, integrated, and strength of character. This is one of the most difficult lessons of life.\"\n> \n> \\- [Jordan B. Peterson](https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/), [12 Rules for Life](https://a.co/d/5q4bKF2)\n\nTo be good, you must be dangerous.\n\nMuch of my life, I equated dangerous with bad. But I have come to realize that a chief aim of the good ought to be to increase their dangerousness. This is necessary when operating in and around evil. \n\nA capacity for evil is not inherently bad. Your capacity is morally neutral, but it is up to you to wield it appropriately. C.S. Lewis illustrates this well when answering the question of why there is evil at all:\n\n> \"‘Why did God make a creature of such rotten stuff that it went wrong?’ The better stuff a creature is made of—the cleverer and stronger and freer it is—then the better it will be if it goes right, but also the worse it will be if it goes wrong. A cow cannot be very good or very bad; a dog can be both better and worse; a child better and worse still; an ordinary man, still more so; a man of genius, still more so; a superhuman spirit best—or worst—of all.\"\n>\n> \\- [C.S.

Sometimes <a href=\"https://winnielim.org/journal/remembering-forgotten-lessons-and-selves/\">I forget and I get lost</a>, so these pieces and connections help to <a href=\"https://winnielim.org/journal/returning-to-ones-core/\">bring me back</a> to who I am and who I aspired to be.</p>\n<p>- <a href=\"https://winnielim.org/\">Winnie Lim</a>, in <a href=\"https://manuelmoreale.com/\">P&amp;B: Winnie Lim</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I appreciate this reframing of a blog post as a &ldquo;piece of my self&rdquo;. As I set out in the early stages of my blog, this captures quite well what I aspire for it to be. Each post is one tiny piece of me, a snapshot in time of one aspect of my self I thought worth sharing. Brought together as a whole, they tell a scattered story of my wanderings.</p>\n<p>Some posts will be technical, some funny, some vulnerable, and some excited, because these are all pieces of my self. I look forward to looking back on years-old posts, and reminiscing where I was on my path at a given time. I already enjoy doing this with personal journal entries, but I have a sense that there will be a unique quality to reflecting on the progression of my blog.</p>\n<p>I am also eager for serendipitous moments when someone encounters one of these pieces of my self, and is so compelled by it that they take time to discuss it with me. Positive or negative, if someone is engaging with one of these pieces of my self then it must have struck a chord, and I think that is a decent signal that I am approximating Truth, which is one of my ultimate aims of this blog. To be truth-seeking in my self and truth-seeking in my interests.</p>\n<p>I already felt this a bit with my recent post on <a href=\"https://weidok.al/2024/02/15/i-use-my.html\">My Obsidian Daily Note Template</a>. I was astounded by how quickly people were adopting parts of it or all of it. As I published it I thought, &ldquo;Is this too &lsquo;in the weeds&rsquo;? Did I waste my time going into all this detail?&rdquo;. But there were people out there, quite a few, looking for someone to guide them through these particular weeds. It is a wonderful feeling to create a point of connection. Something you and another can both behold and say, &ldquo;This resonates&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>So this, too, is one piece among others. If it resonates, I would love to hear from you.</p>\n",

Sometimes [I forget and I get lost](https://winnielim.org/journal/remembering-forgotten-lessons-and-selves/), so these pieces and connections help to [bring me back](https://winnielim.org/journal/returning-to-ones-core/) to who I am and who I aspired to be.\n> \n> \\- [Winnie Lim](https://winnielim.org/), in [P&B: Winnie Lim](https://manuelmoreale.com/)\n\nI appreciate this reframing of a blog post as a \"piece of my self\". As I set out in the early stages of my blog, this captures quite well what I aspire for it to be. Each post is one tiny piece of me, a snapshot in time of one aspect of my self I thought worth sharing. Brought together as a whole, they tell a scattered story of my wanderings.\n\nSome posts will be technical, some funny, some vulnerable, and some excited, because these are all pieces of my self. I look forward to looking back on years-old posts, and reminiscing where I was on my path at a given time. I already enjoy doing this with personal journal entries, but I have a sense that there will be a unique quality to reflecting on the progression of my blog.\n\nI am also eager for serendipitous moments when someone encounters one of these pieces of my self, and is so compelled by it that they take time to discuss it with me. Positive or negative, if someone is engaging with one of these pieces of my self then it must have struck a chord, and I think that is a decent signal that I am approximating Truth, which is one of my ultimate aims of this blog. To be truth-seeking in my self and truth-seeking in my interests.\n\nI already felt this a bit with my recent post on [My Obsidian Daily Note Template](https://weidok.al/2024/02/15/i-use-my.html). I was astounded by how quickly people were adopting parts of it or all of it. As I published it I thought, \"Is this too 'in the weeds'? Did I waste my time going into all this detail?\". But there were people out there, quite a few, looking for someone to guide them through these particular weeds. It is a wonderful feeling to create a point of connection. Something you and another can both behold and say, \"This resonates\".\n\nSo this, too, is one piece among others. If it resonates, I would love to hear from you.\n",

Here&rsquo;s what it looks like:</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>I&rsquo;ll talk more about each individual section later in this post, but overall this daily note has helped me to become more organized and focused. Its primary purpose is managing tasks and rapidly logging notes throughout the day. Having one place to collect both tasks and quick notes has been helpful for me. A nice perk of doing it in Obsidian is that those quick notes can easily evolve into standalone markdown files if they need to, but the key is having a really <em>low friction</em> place to capture a thought or task.</p>\n<p>Having my daily note link to other &ldquo;periodic&rdquo; notes (daily, weekly, monthly) feels very Obsidian-ish, but truth be told I don&rsquo;t use the links too often. They are nice when I need them though, like quickly needing to get to something I logged yesterday.</p>\n<p>I used to use the 5 Minute Journal section more than I do now, but this has been replaced by analog journaling. I sort of miss having this stored digitally, and I&rsquo;m sure I could hack together some awesome digital journal dashboard with Dataview, but that&rsquo;s not really the point, is it? Journaling analog helps me to slow down and really reflect, which seems to make my individual sessions more meaningful. And that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m really looking for. All that being said, I do still like using the 5-Minute Journal occasionally when I&rsquo;m feeling scattered and need a quick dose of mindfulness while at my computer.</p>\n<p>The Today&rsquo;s Notes section is another one I don&rsquo;t use too often, but it&rsquo;s fun to have. I&rsquo;m not using it to navigate between notes I&rsquo;m currently working on that day, because Obsidian has great navigation features I&rsquo;m using instead (e.g., tabs, search). But I do like having it whenever I take a look at past daily notes. It&rsquo;s fun to see a snapshot of what I worked on any given day, and the combination of the daily log, completed tasks, and Today&rsquo;s Notes paints a nice picture of what I was doing and thinking.</p>\n<h1 id=\"plugins\">Plugins</h1>\n<h2 id=\"daily-notes-and-periodic-notes\">Daily Notes and Periodic Notes</h2>\n<p>These plugins both can create a daily note from a specified template file. Periodic Notes allows the creation of some additional types of notes, like weekly, monthly, quarterly, and yearly.</p>\n<p>I prefer to keep my daily notes in their own folder, and each daily note&rsquo;s title is formatted as <code>YYYY-MM-DD</code>.</p>\n<p>I keep my template file in &ldquo;Bins/Templates/Daily Note&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>Here&rsquo;s my config for Daily Notes:</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Here&rsquo;s my config for Periodic Notes (you&rsquo;ll see I also use weekly and monthly notes, which I link to from my daily note):</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<h2 id=\"templater\">Templater</h2>\n<p>With Templater, if I create a file from a template, either manually or through Daily Notes or Periodic Notes, I can run some code from my template <em>when the template is instantiated</em>. This allows me to get things like the current date, daily quote, date ranges for tasks, and file title at the time when I use the template.</p>\n<p>You can even use Templater to run your own JavaScript during note creation, but I am not using that in the current iteration of my daily notes template.</p>\n<p>Here is my current config for Templater:</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>The two important parts are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Specify a template folder (I use &ldquo;Bins/Templates&rdquo;)</li>\n<li>Trigger Templater on new file creation. You want this on so that Templater works with Daily Notes and Periodic Notes.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I use Templater all over my daily note template, and anything between <code>&lt;% ... %&gt;</code> is Templater syntax.</p>\n<h2 id=\"dataview\">Dataview</h2>\n<p>Dataview is a powerful way to query data across all of your notes in your Obsidian vault. For my daily note, I use it to display any notes I created or modified that day.</p>\n<p>I don&rsquo;t believe I did anything unique with the config for Dataview, much of the setup is for viewing preference.</p>\n<h2 id=\"tasks\">Tasks</h2>\n<p>Obsidian is the main place I track tasks digitally, and I use the Tasks plugin to do that. My full setup with Tasks warrants a separate post, but for my daily note I use it to capture tasks in my Daily Log and to display tasks that are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>overdue</li>\n<li>due today</li>\n<li>coming soon (next 3 days)</li>\n<li>completed today</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I haven&rsquo;t changed much from the default Tasks config. I just have it configured to add a &ldquo;done date&rdquo; each time I complete a task.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<h2 id=\"quickadd\">QuickAdd</h2>\n<p>QuickAdd allows running macros from anywhere in Obsidian. I have a macro setup that can be run from anywhere and allows me to quickly write up text that gets appended at the top of my Daily Log with the current timestamp.</p>\n<p>To configure this I created a macro called &ldquo;Capture to daily note&rdquo; in QuickAdd:</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>In the settings for that macro, I tell it where to add the text, and how to create the Daily Note if it has not already been created:</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>To summarize, QuickAdd looks for today&rsquo;s daily note, and then inserts my supplied text after the header I supplied, which is <code>## Daily Log</code>, and gives it some special formatting that I specify near the bottom of the settings. More on this in the Daily Log Section.</p>\n<h2 id=\"buttons\">Buttons</h2>\n<p>Buttons allows you to place buttons in your notes that can run macros. I use a button in my daily note templated to run the QuickAdd macro I described above. This allows me to really quickly capture a short note to my daily log, even if I am viewing my Daily Note on reading mode (which is something I end up doing often from mobile).</p>\n<h2 id=\"calendar\">Calendar</h2>\n<p>I use the calendar plugin to navigate between my daily and weekly notes, and to create them.</p>\n<h1 id=\"the-template\">The Template</h1>\n<p>You can get the full template from this <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/jakeweidokal/027072dc75ddc77ec9595739808db592\">Gist on Github</a>.

If not provided, the function uses today&rsquo;s date when a note is created from it. I supply the file title here so that no matter <em>when</em> I make my daily note, the title in the note matches the file title. For example, I might create tomorrow&rsquo;s daily note ahead of time to start taking notes for tomorrow, so I want the file title to be the date used, NOT today&rsquo;s date during note creation.</li>\n<li>Reference format - the date format for #3</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"navigation\">Navigation</h2>\n<h3 id=\"template-3\">Template</h3>\n<pre tabindex=\"0\"><code>[[ &lt;% tp.date.now(&quot;YYYY-MM-DD&quot;, -1, tp.file.title, &quot;YYYY-MM-DD&quot;) %&gt; | ⬅️ Yesterday]] | [[&lt;% tp.date.now(&quot;YYYY-MM-DD&quot;, 1, tp.file.title, &quot;YYYY-MM-DD&quot;) %&gt; | ➡️ Tomorrow]] | [[&lt;% tp.date.now(&quot;YYYY-[w]WW&quot;, 0, tp.file.title, &quot;YYYY-MM-DD&quot;) %&gt; | 📖 Weekly]] | [[&lt;% tp.date.now(&quot;YYYY-MM&quot;, 0, tp.file.title, &quot;YYYY-MM-DD&quot;) %&gt; | 📅 Monthly]]\n</code></pre><h3 id=\"output-example-2\">Output Example</h3>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<h3 id=\"plugins-used-3\">Plugins Used</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Templater</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"description-3\">Description</h3>\n<p>My navigation section consists of 4 links, each generated with Templater&rsquo;s <code>tp.date.now</code> function to match the title of another &ldquo;periodic&rdquo; note in my vault.</p>\n<p>The 4 links are:</p>\n<p><strong>Yesterday</strong></p>\n<pre tabindex=\"0\"><code>[[ &lt;% tp.date.now(&quot;YYYY-MM-DD&quot;, -1, tp.file.title, &quot;YYYY-MM-DD&quot;) %&gt; | ⬅️ Yesterday]]\n</code></pre><ul>\n<li>Use <code>tp.file.title</code> to get the date, offset -1 for yesterday</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Tomorrow</strong></p>\n<pre tabindex=\"0\"><code>[[&lt;% tp.date.now(&quot;YYYY-MM-DD&quot;, 1, tp.file.title, &quot;YYYY-MM-DD&quot;) %&gt; | ➡️ Tomorrow]]\n</code></pre><ul>\n<li>Use <code>tp.file.title</code> to get the date, offset +1 for tomorrow</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Weekly</strong></p>\n<pre tabindex=\"0\"><code>[[&lt;% tp.date.now(&quot;YYYY-[w]WW&quot;, 0, tp.file.title, &quot;YYYY-MM-DD&quot;) %&gt; | 📖 Weekly]]\n</code></pre><ul>\n<li>Use <code>tp.file.title</code> to get the date, format to my weekly note title format</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Monthly</strong></p>\n<pre tabindex=\"0\"><code>[[&lt;% tp.date.now(&quot;YYYY-MM&quot;, 0, tp.file.title, &quot;YYYY-MM-DD&quot;) %&gt; | 📅 Monthly]]\n</code></pre><ul>\n<li>Use <code>tp.file.title</code> to get the date, format to my monthly note title format</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"daily-log\">Daily Log</h2>\n<h3 id=\"template-4\">Template</h3>\n<pre tabindex=\"0\"><code>```button\nname Add to Log\ntype command\naction QuickAdd: Capture to daily note\ncolor default\n```\n^button-rjgc\n\n## Daily Log\n\n</code></pre><h3 id=\"output-example-3\">Output Example</h3>\n<p>Empty state</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Adding a log with the button</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Example of added log</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<h3 id=\"plugins-used-4\">Plugins Used</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>QuickAdd</li>\n<li>Buttons</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"description-4\">Description</h3>\n<p>I like having a Daily Log section to rapid log tasks, ideas, notes, etc. throughout the day.

Having the button allows me to quickly capture a log even from reading mode</li>\n<li>I like having a timestamp for my log entries. It forces a chronological log I can look back on.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I described how I configured the QuickAdd macro above in the <a href=\"#quickadd\">QuickAdd Plugin section</a>.

I have set up custom callout styles that I&rsquo;ve tailored to my task system. The default styles would work fine too, but you can set up custom styles with CSS Snippets.</p>\n<p>I followed the docs <a href=\"https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Callouts#Customize+callouts\">here</a> to get this set up.</p>\n<p>Under &ldquo;Appearance &gt; CSS Snippets&rdquo;, click the folder icon to open your snippets folder (.obsidian/snippets).</p>\n<p>In this location, create a file called callouts.css that contains the following:</p>\n<pre tabindex=\"0\"><code>.callout[data-callout=&quot;overdue&quot;] {\n  --callout-color: 255, 215, 0;\n  --callout-icon: alarm-clock;\n}\n\n.callout[data-callout=&quot;due-today&quot;] {\n  --callout-color: 12, 248, 161;\n  --callout-icon: check-square;\n}\n\n.callout[data-callout=&quot;coming-soon&quot;] {\n  --callout-color: 37, 202, 227;\n  --callout-icon: timer;\n}\n\n.callout[data-callout=&quot;next-two-weeks&quot;] {\n  --callout-color: 42, 165, 227;\n  --callout-icon: hourglass;\n}\n\n.callout[data-callout=&quot;later&quot;] {\n  --callout-color: 127, 128, 222;\n  --callout-icon: calendar;\n}\n\n.callout[data-callout=&quot;no-date&quot;] {\n  --callout-color: 163, 80, 250;\n  --callout-icon: calendar-off;\n}\n\n.callout[data-callout=&quot;recurring&quot;] {\n  --callout-color: 216, 191, 216;\n  --callout-icon: repeat;\n}\n\n.callout[data-callout=&quot;personal&quot;] {\n  --callout-color: 240, 240, 240;\n  --callout-icon: user;\n}\n\n.callout[data-callout=&quot;work&quot;] {\n  --callout-color: 240, 240, 240;\n  --callout-icon: briefcase;\n}\n</code></pre><p>Go back to &ldquo;Appearance &gt; CSS Snippets&rdquo; and click the refresh icon to reload the snippets into Obsidian&rsquo;s styles.</p>\n<p>Now you can use these callout type identifiers to style your callouts. These are the custom callout types I use to contain different types of tasks. I don&rsquo;t use all of these in my daily note, some show up in other places like my Tasks Dashboard.</p>\n<h4 id=\"grouping-tasks\">Grouping Tasks</h4>\n<p>For my daily note, I like my task queries to show tasks in a certain date range (e.g., overdue, due today, due in the next 3 days, completed today) and then within the query, I like to group my tasks by whether they are related to work, personal, or uncategorized. I use tags to assign my tasks to projects, so I look at the tag to determine which group a task should fall into.</p>\n<p>My tag structure for organizing tasks has three sections: <code>#{prefix}/{area}/{project}</code>. An example tag would be: <code>#p/personal/website</code>. I prefix all project tags with <code>p/</code> so that I can quickly pull them all up in the typeahead menu when I start typing a tag. The second part of the tag is the area that the project belongs to, which is either &ldquo;work&rdquo; or &ldquo;personal&rdquo; in my setup. This is what I like to group my tasks on.</p>\n<p>To accomplish this, at the end of my tasks query I have:</p>\n<pre tabindex=\"0\"><code>group by function task.tags.map( (tag) =&gt; tag.split('/')[1] ? tag.split('/').slice(0, 2).join('/') : '')\n</code></pre><p>Here&rsquo;s what this is doing for each task:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>it looks to see, &ldquo;Does this task have a tag with an area section?&rdquo;</li>\n<li>if it does, it cuts off the project from the end, and returns the area like: <code>#{prefix}/{area}</code></li>\n<li>if it does not, it returns empty</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So then my tasks fall into one of 3 groups:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Personal</li>\n<li>Work</li>\n<li>Uncategorized</li>\n</ol>\n<p>My &ldquo;due soon&rdquo; tasks query takes grouping even further, and groups tasks first by their due date and then sub-groups into the areas I defined above.</p>\n<h2 id=\"5-minute-journal\">5 Minute Journal</h2>\n<h3 id=\"template-6\">Template</h3>\n<pre tabindex=\"0\"><code>## 5 Minute Journal\n\n### 🌞\n**3 things I am grateful for...**\n1. \n\n**What will I do to make today great?**\n- \n\n**Daily affirmations**\n\n\n### 🌚\n**What were the highlights from your day?**\n1. \n\n**How could I have made today even better?**\n\n</code></pre><h3 id=\"output-example-5\">Output Example</h3>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<h3 id=\"plugins-used-6\">Plugins Used</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>N/A</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"description-6\">Description</h3>\n<p>This section is my quick daily dose of mindfulness when I need it.

				"content_text": "I use my [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) daily note as my main digital jumping-off point for things like:\n\n- habits\n- daily log\n- tasks\n- journaling\n\nI've gathered ideas for setting this up from all over the internet over many months, and unfortunately, I don't recall all the resources I used. [Dann Berg's post](https://dannb.org/blog/2022/obsidian-daily-note-template/) inspired my \"Today's Notes\" section, and I first learned a lot about Obsidian from [Nick Milo's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@linkingyourthinking).\n \nBelow I outline what my template looks like, and how I set it up.\n \n# Table of Contents\n\n- [Overview](#overview)\n- [Plugins](#plugins)\n\t- [Daily Notes and Periodic Notes](#daily-notes-and-periodic-notes)\n\t- [Templater](#templater)\n\t- [Dataview](#dataview)\n\t- [Tasks](#tasks)\n\t- [QuickAdd](#quickadd)\n\t- [Buttons](#buttons)\n\t- [Calendar](#calendar)\n- [The Template](#the-template)\n\t- [Frontmatter Habits](#frontmatter-habits)\n\t- [Daily Quote](#daily-quote)\n\t- [Title](#title)\n\t- [Navigation](#navigation)\n\t- [Daily Log](#daily-log)\n\t- [Tasks](#tasks-1)\n\t- [5 Minute Journal](#5-minute-journal)\n\t- [Today's Notes](#todays-notes)\n- [Final Thoughts](#final-thoughts)\n\n# Overview\n\nMy template allows me to have the same daily note created for me each day. Here's what it looks like:\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/139317/2024/obsidian-daily-note-1.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"1902\" alt=\"Example of Jake's full daily note template\">\n\nI'll talk more about each individual section later in this post, but overall this daily note has helped me to become more organized and focused. Its primary purpose is managing tasks and rapidly logging notes throughout the day. Having one place to collect both tasks and quick notes has been helpful for me. A nice perk of doing it in Obsidian is that those quick notes can easily evolve into standalone markdown files if they need to, but the key is having a really *low friction* place to capture a thought or task.\n\nHaving my daily note link to other \"periodic\" notes (daily, weekly, monthly) feels very Obsidian-ish, but truth be told I don't use the links too often. They are nice when I need them though, like quickly needing to get to something I logged yesterday.\n\nI used to use the 5 Minute Journal section more than I do now, but this has been replaced by analog journaling. I sort of miss having this stored digitally, and I'm sure I could hack together some awesome digital journal dashboard with Dataview, but that's not really the point, is it? Journaling analog helps me to slow down and really reflect, which seems to make my individual sessions more meaningful. And that's what I'm really looking for. All that being said, I do still like using the 5-Minute Journal occasionally when I'm feeling scattered and need a quick dose of mindfulness while at my computer.\n\nThe Today's Notes section is another one I don't use too often, but it's fun to have. I'm not using it to navigate between notes I'm currently working on that day, because Obsidian has great navigation features I'm using instead (e.g., tabs, search). But I do like having it whenever I take a look at past daily notes. It's fun to see a snapshot of what I worked on any given day, and the combination of the daily log, completed tasks, and Today's Notes paints a nice picture of what I was doing and thinking.\n\n# Plugins\n\n## Daily Notes and Periodic Notes\n\nThese plugins both can create a daily note from a specified template file. Periodic Notes allows the creation of some additional types of notes, like weekly, monthly, quarterly, and yearly. \n\nI prefer to keep my daily notes in their own folder, and each daily note's title is formatted as `YYYY-MM-DD`.\n\nI keep my template file in \"Bins/Templates/Daily Note\".\n\nHere's my config for Daily Notes:\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/139317/2024/obsidian-daily-note-2.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"268\" alt=\"\">\n\nHere's my config for Periodic Notes (you'll see I also use weekly and monthly notes, which I link to from my daily note):\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/139317/2024/obsidian-daily-note-3.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"452\" alt=\"\">\n\n## Templater\n\nWith Templater, if I create a file from a template, either manually or through Daily Notes or Periodic Notes, I can run some code from my template *when the template is instantiated*. This allows me to get things like the current date, daily quote, date ranges for tasks, and file title at the time when I use the template.\n\nYou can even use Templater to run your own JavaScript during note creation, but I am not using that in the current iteration of my daily notes template.\n\nHere is my current config for Templater:\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/139317/2024/obsidian-daily-note-4.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"477\" alt=\"\">\n\nThe two important parts are:\n\n1. Specify a template folder (I use \"Bins/Templates\")\n2. Trigger Templater on new file creation. You want this on so that Templater works with Daily Notes and Periodic Notes.\n\nI use Templater all over my daily note template, and anything between `<% ... %>` is Templater syntax.\n\n## Dataview\n\nDataview is a powerful way to query data across all of your notes in your Obsidian vault. For my daily note, I use it to display any notes I created or modified that day.\n\nI don't believe I did anything unique with the config for Dataview, much of the setup is for viewing preference.\n\n## Tasks\n\nObsidian is the main place I track tasks digitally, and I use the Tasks plugin to do that. My full setup with Tasks warrants a separate post, but for my daily note I use it to capture tasks in my Daily Log and to display tasks that are:\n\n- overdue\n- due today\n- coming soon (next 3 days)\n- completed today\n\nI haven't changed much from the default Tasks config. I just have it configured to add a \"done date\" each time I complete a task.\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/139317/2024/pasted-image-20240119172358.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"316\" alt=\"\">\n\n## QuickAdd\n\nQuickAdd allows running macros from anywhere in Obsidian. I have a macro setup that can be run from anywhere and allows me to quickly write up text that gets appended at the top of my Daily Log with the current timestamp.\n\nTo configure this I created a macro called \"Capture to daily note\" in QuickAdd:\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/139317/2024/obsidian-daily-note-5.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"302\" alt=\"QuickAdd settings config\">\n\nIn the settings for that macro, I tell it where to add the text, and how to create the Daily Note if it has not already been created:\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/139317/2024/obsidian-daily-note-6.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"643\" alt=\"macro settings config\">\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/139317/2024/pasted-image-20240119172535.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"517\" alt=\"\">\n\nTo summarize, QuickAdd looks for today's daily note, and then inserts my supplied text after the header I supplied, which is `## Daily Log`, and gives it some special formatting that I specify near the bottom of the settings. More on this in the Daily Log Section.\n\n## Buttons\n\nButtons allows you to place buttons in your notes that can run macros. I use a button in my daily note templated to run the QuickAdd macro I described above. This allows me to really quickly capture a short note to my daily log, even if I am viewing my Daily Note on reading mode (which is something I end up doing often from mobile).\n\n## Calendar\n\nI use the calendar plugin to navigate between my daily and weekly notes, and to create them. \n\n# The Template\n\nYou can get the full template from this [Gist on Github](https://gist.github.com/jakeweidokal/027072dc75ddc77ec9595739808db592). Below I'll break down the template by section so you can take only the pieces and parts you need.\n\n## Frontmatter Habits\n\n### Template\n\n```\n---\nweek: <% tp.date.now('ww',0, tp.file.title, 'YYYY-MM-DD') %>\nweight:\nstartEating:\nendEating:\ntags: daily\n---\n```\n\n### Plugins Used\n\n- Templater\n\n### Description\n\nFor my habits section, I use the YAML frontmatter of the markdown file to track any daily habits. I use Templater to get the week number and save it as a property. I also use the Frontmatter to tag all daily notes with the `#daily` tag.  After that, all additional front matter fields are used to track daily metrics, which could be things like weight, times, mood, etc. \n\nTo be honest, I don't use this much anymore, but it was useful when I was doing intermittent fasting. I was eating within an 8 hour window each day, so I used this section to track when I started eating, when I stopped eating, and my weight. Then, with this data stored in each daily note, I used the Obsidian Charts plugin in my weekly and monthly notes to trend my progress over time. If you are interested in how this is setup, shoot me an email and let me know.\n\nExample of Obsidian Charts in one of my monthly notes:\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/139317/2024/obsidian-daily-note-7.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"308\" alt=\"Obsidian chart showing weight and eating windows charted over a month\">\n\n## Daily Quote\n\n### Template\n\n```\n<% tp.web.daily_quote() %>\n```\n\n### Output Example\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/139317/2024/obsidian-daily-note-8.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"104\" alt=\"A quote from peter drucker that says the best way to predict your future is to create it\">\n\n### Plugins Used\n\n- Templater\n\n### Description\n\nI like having a new quote at the top of each of my daily notes. Templater has a built-in function I use that returns the quote of the day when the template is instantiated.\n\n## Title\n\n### Template\n\n```\n# <% tp.date.now(\"dddd, MMMM Do YYYY\", 0, tp.file.title, \"YYYY-MM-DD\") %>\n```\n\n### Output Example\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/139317/2024/obsidian-daily-note-9.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"85\" alt=\"a screesnhot showing the text Friday, January 19th 2024\">\n\n### Plugins Used\n\n- Templater\n\n### Description\n\nAll my daily notes have a file title in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`, but I like having a more readable format that includes the weekday.\n\nI use the `tp.date.now` function to format the date from the title of the file. Here are what the 4 different parameters in the function do:\n\n1. Format - sets the format for the date\n2. Offset - I keep this at 0 because I want the current date. 1 would give me tomorrow, -1 would give me yesterday.\n3. Reference - the date to use. If not provided, the function uses today's date when a note is created from it. I supply the file title here so that no matter *when* I make my daily note, the title in the note matches the file title. For example, I might create tomorrow's daily note ahead of time to start taking notes for tomorrow, so I want the file title to be the date used, NOT today's date during note creation.\n4. Reference format - the date format for #3\n\n## Navigation\n\n### Template\n\n```\n[[ <% tp.date.now(\"YYYY-MM-DD\", -1, tp.file.title, \"YYYY-MM-DD\") %> | ⬅️ Yesterday]] | [[<% tp.date.now(\"YYYY-MM-DD\", 1, tp.file.title, \"YYYY-MM-DD\") %> | ➡️ Tomorrow]] | [[<% tp.date.now(\"YYYY-[w]WW\", 0, tp.file.title, \"YYYY-MM-DD\") %> | 📖 Weekly]] | [[<% tp.date.now(\"YYYY-MM\", 0, tp.file.title, \"YYYY-MM-DD\") %> | 📅 Monthly]]\n```\n\n### Output Example\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/139317/2024/obsidian-daily-note-10.png\" width=\"342\" height=\"21\" alt=\"Markdown links for yesterday, tomorrow, weekly, monthly\">\n\n### Plugins Used\n\n- Templater\n\n### Description\n\nMy navigation section consists of 4 links, each generated with Templater's `tp.date.now` function to match the title of another \"periodic\" note in my vault.\n\nThe 4 links are:\n\n**Yesterday**\n\n```\n[[ <% tp.date.now(\"YYYY-MM-DD\", -1, tp.file.title, \"YYYY-MM-DD\") %> | ⬅️ Yesterday]]\n```\n\n- Use `tp.file.title` to get the date, offset -1 for yesterday\n\n**Tomorrow**\n\n```\n[[<% tp.date.now(\"YYYY-MM-DD\", 1, tp.file.title, \"YYYY-MM-DD\") %> | ➡️ Tomorrow]]\n```\n\n- Use `tp.file.title` to get the date, offset +1 for tomorrow\n\n**Weekly**\n\n```\n[[<% tp.date.now(\"YYYY-[w]WW\", 0, tp.file.title, \"YYYY-MM-DD\") %> | 📖 Weekly]]\n```\n\n- Use `tp.file.title` to get the date, format to my weekly note title format\n\n**Monthly**\n\n```\n[[<% tp.date.now(\"YYYY-MM\", 0, tp.file.title, \"YYYY-MM-DD\") %> | 📅 Monthly]]\n```\n\n- Use `tp.file.title` to get the date, format to my monthly note title format\n\n## Daily Log\n\n### Template\n\n````\n```button\nname Add to Log\ntype command\naction QuickAdd: Capture to daily note\ncolor default\n```\n^button-rjgc\n\n## Daily Log\n\n````\n\n### Output Example\n\nEmpty state\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/139317/2024/obsidian-daily-note-11.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"117\" alt=\"\">\n\nAdding a log with the button\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/139317/2024/obsidian-daily-note-12.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"124\" alt=\"\">\n\nExample of added log\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/139317/2024/obsidian-daily-note-13.png\" width=\"593\" height=\"150\" alt=\"\">\n\n### Plugins Used\n\n- QuickAdd\n- Buttons\n\n### Description\n\nI like having a Daily Log section to rapid log tasks, ideas, notes, etc. throughout the day. I added a button to help me do this for two reasons:\n\n1. I use Obsidian mobile, and often view notes in reading mode from my phone. Having the button allows me to quickly capture a log even from reading mode\n2. I like having a timestamp for my log entries. It forces a chronological log I can look back on.\n\nI described how I configured the QuickAdd macro above in the [QuickAdd Plugin section](#quickadd). Once the QuickAdd macro is configured, I can add the Button to my template and use the `command` type to call my QuickAdd macro. \n\nI do often add things to my daily note without using the \"Add to Log\" button. This section is where I create and store my tasks 97% of the time. That way, my task location is the daily note, so I can easily see the date it was created and I get the associated context of everything else stored in my daily note.\n\n\n## Tasks\n\n### Template\n\n```\n## [[Tasks Dashboard | Tasks]]\n\n> [!overdue]+ Due before <% tp.file.title %>\n> ```tasks\n> due before <% tp.date.now(\"YYYY-MM-DD\", 0, tp.file.title, \"YYYY-MM-DD\") %>\n> not done\n> hide due date\n> hide recurrence rule\n> group by function task.tags.map( (tag) => tag.split('/')[1] ? tag.split('/').slice(0, 2).join('/') : '')\n> ```\n\n> [!due-today]+ Due <% tp.file.title %>\n> ```tasks\n> due <% tp.date.now(\"YYYY-MM-DD\", 0, tp.file.title, \"YYYY-MM-DD\") %>\n> not done\n> hide due date\n> hide recurrence rule\n> group by function task.tags.map( (tag) => tag.split('/')[1] ? tag.split('/').slice(0, 2).join('/') : '')\n\n> [!coming-soon]- Due soon after <% tp.file.title %>\n> ```tasks\n> due after <% tp.date.now(\"YYYY-MM-DD\", 0, tp.file.title, \"YYYY-MM-DD\") %>\n> due before <% tp.date.now(\"YYYY-MM-DD\", 4, tp.file.title, \"YYYY-MM-DD\") %>\n> not done\n> hide due date\n> hide recurrence rule\n> group by due\n> group by function task.tags.map( (tag) => tag.split('/')[1] ? tag.split('/').slice(0, 2).join('/') : '')\n> ```\n\n> [!success]- Completed <% tp.file.title %>\n> ```tasks\n> done <% tp.date.now(\"YYYY-MM-DD\", 0, tp.file.title, \"YYYY-MM-DD\") %>\n> short mode\n> ```\n```\n\n### Output Example\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/139317/2024/obsidian-daily-note-14.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"1658\" alt=\"Multiple tasks lists for overdue, due today, coming soon, and completed\">\n\n### Plugins Used\n\n- Templater\n- Tasks\n\n### Description\n\n#### Setting Up CSS Snippets for Callout Styles\n\nBefore I get into the task queries for the template, I'll mention that I use callouts to contain my task queries because I like the color-coded separation, and I like being able to collapse/expand my task lists. I have set up custom callout styles that I've tailored to my task system. The default styles would work fine too, but you can set up custom styles with CSS Snippets. \n\nI followed the docs [here](https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Callouts#Customize+callouts) to get this set up.\n\nUnder \"Appearance > CSS Snippets\", click the folder icon to open your snippets folder (.obsidian/snippets).\n\nIn this location, create a file called callouts.css that contains the following:\n\n```\n.callout[data-callout=\"overdue\"] {\n  --callout-color: 255, 215, 0;\n  --callout-icon: alarm-clock;\n}\n\n.callout[data-callout=\"due-today\"] {\n  --callout-color: 12, 248, 161;\n  --callout-icon: check-square;\n}\n\n.callout[data-callout=\"coming-soon\"] {\n  --callout-color: 37, 202, 227;\n  --callout-icon: timer;\n}\n\n.callout[data-callout=\"next-two-weeks\"] {\n  --callout-color: 42, 165, 227;\n  --callout-icon: hourglass;\n}\n\n.callout[data-callout=\"later\"] {\n  --callout-color: 127, 128, 222;\n  --callout-icon: calendar;\n}\n\n.callout[data-callout=\"no-date\"] {\n  --callout-color: 163, 80, 250;\n  --callout-icon: calendar-off;\n}\n\n.callout[data-callout=\"recurring\"] {\n  --callout-color: 216, 191, 216;\n  --callout-icon: repeat;\n}\n\n.callout[data-callout=\"personal\"] {\n  --callout-color: 240, 240, 240;\n  --callout-icon: user;\n}\n\n.callout[data-callout=\"work\"] {\n  --callout-color: 240, 240, 240;\n  --callout-icon: briefcase;\n}\n```\n\nGo back to \"Appearance > CSS Snippets\" and click the refresh icon to reload the snippets into Obsidian's styles. \n\nNow you can use these callout type identifiers to style your callouts. These are the custom callout types I use to contain different types of tasks. I don't use all of these in my daily note, some show up in other places like my Tasks Dashboard.\n\n#### Grouping Tasks\n\nFor my daily note, I like my task queries to show tasks in a certain date range (e.g., overdue, due today, due in the next 3 days, completed today) and then within the query, I like to group my tasks by whether they are related to work, personal, or uncategorized. I use tags to assign my tasks to projects, so I look at the tag to determine which group a task should fall into.\n\nMy tag structure for organizing tasks has three sections: `#{prefix}/{area}/{project}`. An example tag would be: `#p/personal/website`. I prefix all project tags with `p/` so that I can quickly pull them all up in the typeahead menu when I start typing a tag. The second part of the tag is the area that the project belongs to, which is either \"work\" or \"personal\" in my setup. This is what I like to group my tasks on.\n\nTo accomplish this, at the end of my tasks query I have:\n\n```\ngroup by function task.tags.map( (tag) => tag.split('/')[1] ? tag.split('/').slice(0, 2).join('/') : '')\n```\n\nHere's what this is doing for each task:\n\n- it looks to see, \"Does this task have a tag with an area section?\"\n- if it does, it cuts off the project from the end, and returns the area like: `#{prefix}/{area}`\n- if it does not, it returns empty\n\nSo then my tasks fall into one of 3 groups:\n\n1. Personal\n2. Work\n3. Uncategorized\n\nMy \"due soon\" tasks query takes grouping even further, and groups tasks first by their due date and then sub-groups into the areas I defined above. \n\n## 5 Minute Journal\n\n### Template\n\n```\n## 5 Minute Journal\n\n### 🌞\n**3 things I am grateful for...**\n1. \n\n**What will I do to make today great?**\n- \n\n**Daily affirmations**\n\n\n### 🌚\n**What were the highlights from your day?**\n1. \n\n**How could I have made today even better?**\n\n```\n\n### Output Example\n \n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/139317/2024/obsidian-daily-note-15.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"407\" alt=\"5 minute journal prompts\">\n\n### Plugins Used\n\n- N/A\n\n### Description\n\nThis section is my quick daily dose of mindfulness when I need it.

I like being able to trace this history where I can go back to a daily note and see what I was working on in Obsidian that day. \n\nThe logic for Created Today is show files that:\n\n- were created on or after today at 12AM\n- were created on or before tomorrow at 12AM\n- except for this daily note\n\nThe logic for Modified Today is show files that:\n\n- were modified on or after today at 12AM\n- were modified on or before tomorrow at 12AM\n- except for this daily note\n\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nI hope this helps you with setting up your own Daily Note template! I took inspiration from many places to put this together, and I hope to give back to the Obsidian community by sharing how I use my Daily Note. It is where I spend at least 80% of my time in Obsidian.\n",

Pay attention to what you have; your possessions do not watch themselves and will not last on their own. \n",

				"content_html": "<p>Below are some thoughts I typed up the morning before my wife was induced for our first child. I recall feeling especially reflective that morning, and I was trying to prepare myself for what was ahead (note: I was/am still unprepared, but I&rsquo;ve managed to figure things out on the fly so far).</p>\n<h1 id=\"2023-07-05-thoughts-on-the-day-of-the-induction\">2023-07-05 Thoughts on the Day of the Induction</h1>\n<p>Soon I am going to be a dad and my wife is going to be a mom. It is strange how major change can be right in front of my face, and yet it is hard to believe that it is coming. But how will things change? How can I know what change will be like before it has made its way into my life and started to rearrange things I once cared for? Will I be sad at losing things? Certain freedoms? Or will my values and beliefs be changed?</p>\n<p>It feels more like the latter, but I have no idea how that will play out. I think I will miss some freedoms from before having a baby, like getting sleep whenever I want, but on the whole, I think this will be a good change and I am really looking forward to it.</p>\n<p>Here is what I think <em>will change</em>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Less sleep, especially early on</li>\n<li>I will develop a larger capacity for love</li>\n<li>If I do it right, I will slow down and see the world through a child&rsquo;s eyes once again</li>\n<li>Life will become less flexible in some ways - not able to disc golf as much, trickier to go into the office for work, etc.</li>\n<li>My wife and I will need to unite around a common goal in a way that we really haven&rsquo;t had to before</li>\n<li>Less time to myself</li>\n<li>More laughter</li>\n<li>Really more of all emotions. I think life will become more vivid and intense, as long as I lean in</li>\n<li>More walks (I am really excited to use the fancy stroller we got 😂)</li>\n<li>Less of an aversion to grossness. Getting accustomed to changing dirty diapers and getting poo/pee on myself</li>\n<li>More wonder and awe</li>\n<li>More prioritizing family. It is easy to dive into work and get consumed with projects I am working on, but I think it will become easier/more important to be giving myself to my family</li>\n<li>Less self-centeredness</li>\n<li>Less screen time (This will not magically change on its own, but I will be focusing on this. I do NOT want to be the dad that has his face in his phone while his daughter is wanting to be seen by him.)</li>\n<li>My WHY will be strengthened. I will have more purpose and conviction behind my actions.</li>\n<li>The burden of responsibility on my shoulders will be increased</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Someday when my daughter describes her dad <em>I hope she will say</em>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>He loved me</li>\n<li>We had so much fun together</li>\n<li>He was goofy and embarrassed me in school</li>\n<li>He was my example for following Jesus</li>\n<li>He showed me how a good man should treat me</li>\n<li>He could beat up all the other dads 😂</li>\n<li>He was there when I needed a shoulder to cry on</li>\n<li>He got out of his comfort zone to try things I wanted to do</li>\n<li>He didn&rsquo;t raise his voice at me unless he had to keep me safe</li>\n<li>He loved mom</li>\n<li>He encouraged my interests</li>\n<li>He taught me right from wrong</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"reflections\">Reflections</h1>\n<p>Now that I my daughter is over 5 months old, I&rsquo;m impressed with my past self that most of his predictions were pretty close. I&rsquo;d like to reflect on some of what I got right/wrong.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Will I be sad at losing things? Certain freedoms? Or will my values and beliefs be changed?</p>\n<p>It feels more like the latter, but I have no idea how that will play out.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I have found it to be true that my values have shifted some. It was not such a big and dramatic immediate change as I had expected, but I have not felt sad about losing any freedoms from before my daughter was born.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I will develop a larger capacity for love</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if my capacity for love is larger or not, but close moments with her do hit differently. Baby giggles or moments when it is just the two of us looking into each other&rsquo;s eyes make my heart so full.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If I do it right, I will slow down and see the world through a child&rsquo;s eyes once again</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I am still working on this, and I want to do this more. I think I will be forced into this soon, as she will begin crawling in the next couple of months, so I&rsquo;m going to need to put my baby cap on to identify all the hazards we may still have on the floors.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>My wife and I will need to unite around a common goal in a way that we really haven&rsquo;t had to before</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yes. Having a baby has been very uniting, but also brings about a number of disagreements over strongly held opinions on parenting. So far, we have centered around &ldquo;safety&rdquo; as our tiebreaker to determine which opinion we should go with when we can&rsquo;t come to agreement through talking about it. It is interesting that so many of our opinions are rooted in our own childhood experiences, so in a lot of our disagreements it is more important to empathize with each other about past experiences than to rationalize about the current situation. When we empathize, we both tend to feel much better about the approach we decide on. The core to all of this is a mutual understanding that we are on the same team, and we both want the best for our daughter, even when we are coming at it from different angles.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Less time to myself</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Finding time for <em>me</em> has become much more challenging. The only alone time I&rsquo;ve found has come early in the morning, before the girls are awake. Surprisingly though, changing diapers in the middle of the night has made it <em>easier</em> to get up early. It has been very refreshing for me to get up around 4:30 or 5:00, make a warm cup of coffee, and then either journal, read a book, or work on a personal project. I&rsquo;d like to incorporate more exercise into my &ldquo;me time&rdquo;, but the time feels so short and I&rsquo;m having way more fun doing stuff like writing this post. I know I will feel so much better if I just suck it up and do the exercise though, and I can find ways to be fast and still have time for the other things I enjoy.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Really more of all emotions.

I have found that I am still just as prone toward distraction though, and while I get distracted with flashy colors and noises (YouTube), the color in front of my eyes slowly sucks the color out of life around me. I feel grayer and duller when I am giving into distractions. It is sad that this numbing has become the norm in our society, with so many of us getting off of work and going straight to TV, phone, video games, you name it.

This value is realized on a scale of years, or even decades, when my family will be able to look back and see how much I loved them, even in the little moments.

				"content_text": "Below are some thoughts I typed up the morning before my wife was induced for our first child. I recall feeling especially reflective that morning, and I was trying to prepare myself for what was ahead (note: I was/am still unprepared, but I've managed to figure things out on the fly so far).\n\n# 2023-07-05 Thoughts on the Day of the Induction\n\nSoon I am going to be a dad and my wife is going to be a mom. It is strange how major change can be right in front of my face, and yet it is hard to believe that it is coming. But how will things change? How can I know what change will be like before it has made its way into my life and started to rearrange things I once cared for? Will I be sad at losing things? Certain freedoms? Or will my values and beliefs be changed?\n\nIt feels more like the latter, but I have no idea how that will play out. I think I will miss some freedoms from before having a baby, like getting sleep whenever I want, but on the whole, I think this will be a good change and I am really looking forward to it.\n\nHere is what I think *will change*:\n- Less sleep, especially early on\n- I will develop a larger capacity for love\n- If I do it right, I will slow down and see the world through a child's eyes once again\n- Life will become less flexible in some ways - not able to disc golf as much, trickier to go into the office for work, etc.\n- My wife and I will need to unite around a common goal in a way that we really haven't had to before\n- Less time to myself\n- More laughter\n- Really more of all emotions. I think life will become more vivid and intense, as long as I lean in\n- More walks (I am really excited to use the fancy stroller we got 😂)\n- Less of an aversion to grossness. Getting accustomed to changing dirty diapers and getting poo/pee on myself\n- More wonder and awe\n- More prioritizing family. It is easy to dive into work and get consumed with projects I am working on, but I think it will become easier/more important to be giving myself to my family\n- Less self-centeredness\n- Less screen time (This will not magically change on its own, but I will be focusing on this. I do NOT want to be the dad that has his face in his phone while his daughter is wanting to be seen by him.)\n- My WHY will be strengthened. I will have more purpose and conviction behind my actions.\n- The burden of responsibility on my shoulders will be increased\n\nSomeday when my daughter describes her dad *I hope she will say*:\n- He loved me\n- We had so much fun together\n- He was goofy and embarrassed me in school\n- He was my example for following Jesus\n- He showed me how a good man should treat me\n- He could beat up all the other dads 😂\n- He was there when I needed a shoulder to cry on\n- He got out of his comfort zone to try things I wanted to do\n- He didn't raise his voice at me unless he had to keep me safe\n- He loved mom\n- He encouraged my interests\n- He taught me right from wrong\n\n# Reflections\n\nNow that I my daughter is over 5 months old, I'm impressed with my past self that most of his predictions were pretty close. I'd like to reflect on some of what I got right/wrong.\n\n> Will I be sad at losing things? Certain freedoms? Or will my values and beliefs be changed?\n> \n> It feels more like the latter, but I have no idea how that will play out.\n\nI have found it to be true that my values have shifted some. It was not such a big and dramatic immediate change as I had expected, but I have not felt sad about losing any freedoms from before my daughter was born.\n\n> I will develop a larger capacity for love\n\nI'm not sure if my capacity for love is larger or not, but close moments with her do hit differently. Baby giggles or moments when it is just the two of us looking into each other's eyes make my heart so full.\n\n> If I do it right, I will slow down and see the world through a child's eyes once again\n\nI am still working on this, and I want to do this more. I think I will be forced into this soon, as she will begin crawling in the next couple of months, so I'm going to need to put my baby cap on to identify all the hazards we may still have on the floors.\n\n> My wife and I will need to unite around a common goal in a way that we really haven't had to before\n\nYes. Having a baby has been very uniting, but also brings about a number of disagreements over strongly held opinions on parenting. So far, we have centered around \"safety\" as our tiebreaker to determine which opinion we should go with when we can't come to agreement through talking about it. It is interesting that so many of our opinions are rooted in our own childhood experiences, so in a lot of our disagreements it is more important to empathize with each other about past experiences than to rationalize about the current situation. When we empathize, we both tend to feel much better about the approach we decide on. The core to all of this is a mutual understanding that we are on the same team, and we both want the best for our daughter, even when we are coming at it from different angles.\n\n> Less time to myself\n\nFinding time for *me* has become much more challenging. The only alone time I've found has come early in the morning, before the girls are awake. Surprisingly though, changing diapers in the middle of the night has made it *easier* to get up early. It has been very refreshing for me to get up around 4:30 or 5:00, make a warm cup of coffee, and then either journal, read a book, or work on a personal project.

I think life will become more vivid and intense, as long as I lean in\n\nWhen I can keep myself free from attention-grabbing distractions (looking at you, phone) and I can focus my whole being on time with my family, this is true. I have found that I am still just as prone toward distraction though, and while I get distracted with flashy colors and noises (YouTube), the color in front of my eyes slowly sucks the color out of life around me.

Yes this is true, but I haven't felt weighed down at all.\n\n> Someday when my daughter describes her dad *I hope she will say*:\n\nI won't be able to reflect on the real-life outcomes of this section for another 20+ years. But all of these hopes are still true. I was emotional as I wrote it originally, and I am emotional again thinking about this.
